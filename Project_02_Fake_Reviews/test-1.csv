Home_and_Kitchen_5,1,"Really great, soft and warm. I love the feel of this blanket."
Home_and_Kitchen_5,1,"LESS THEN 1 YEAR OLD, BUT NO MORE!!  I've had mine for 2 months now"
Home_and_Kitchen_5,1,Perfect for what I needed. I love the look and feel of this pillow.
Home_and_Kitchen_5,1,Bought this just to pick up an old mattress and it was a nice piece of equipment. 
Home_and_Kitchen_5,1,the plastic rings either gone or destroyed the pieces.  I will keep my old ones as gifts.
Home_and_Kitchen_5,1,"Nice just more trouble then it looks, the finish is a bit thin, not the best quality."
Home_and_Kitchen_5,1,Great Seller. Item just like it.Great quality and just what I needed for my kitchen! 
Home_and_Kitchen_5,1,Very cute. Go with what you have. Not too big or too small.
Home_and_Kitchen_5,1,looks high end and feels nice. The only problem is that it's kind of hard to put
Home_and_Kitchen_5,1,"This mug is VERY nice.  I love the look and feel of it, and the size and"
Home_and_Kitchen_5,1,It works really well it looks great and the materials are good.  I have a large one and
Home_and_Kitchen_5,1,Ordered this as a gift and it arrived on time. I will keep my review for the next
Home_and_Kitchen_5,1,Beautiful calming light. Not sure what it is. We love this blanket.
Home_and_Kitchen_5,1,I like the clock although it has the design flaw which is that it is a little hard to read
Home_and_Kitchen_5,1,Exactly as advertised. Better quality than the original. We love this blanket.
Home_and_Kitchen_5,1,Perfect solution to sorting his messes and the tools. I also love that it's removable and can
Home_and_Kitchen_5,1,"very cute item, going to go with the wide wooden legs for a nice dinner table."
Home_and_Kitchen_5,1,Beautious!  The perfect wall clock.  It's a good size and looks great in my
Home_and_Kitchen_5,1,Just OK. Am buying a second set.I love these containers.  They work well and look
Home_and_Kitchen_5,1,Great comforter especially when you are on the go.  I will keep my shelves in order
Home_and_Kitchen_5,1,These are very nice mugs.  They are very long and fit nicely on my shelves. 
Home_and_Kitchen_5,0,"Yup, they work and they came on time. What else does one say about vacuum cleaner bags. Oh, the paper/mesh is an improvement over old bags of sizes."
Home_and_Kitchen_5,0,"These are great!  Strong, multiple sizes, very high quality.  I have bought cheap-o brands that break easily.  These seem pretty much unbreakable.  Excellent product."
Home_and_Kitchen_5,0,"it works just like a regular size ironing board, but much handier to use and easier to store,and the flatter the surface its on the better it irons."
Home_and_Kitchen_5,0,This looks so good and really changes the look of the bathroom. We were going for a Game of Thrones theme and it works perfectly for our purpose.
Home_and_Kitchen_5,0,The Pointehaven  heavyweight flannel sheet set is so pretty and soft and cuddly. Matched with the snowflake blanket it makes a wonderful gift or enjoy it yourself.
Home_and_Kitchen_5,0,This is a good steamer for travel. Very effective. Since travel size you have to fill the tank with water a few times which is not a hassle.
Home_and_Kitchen_5,0,This is just like what my mom used when I was growing up. Every time I use it I feel like she is in the kitchen with me.
Home_and_Kitchen_5,0,My hands are quite arthritic and this has really be a help in opening all sorts of bottles and jars.  It is easy to use and works!
Home_and_Kitchen_5,0,"I bought several different styles and lengths and love them all.  They arrived quickly, packaged well and the best part is that they are MADE IN USA."
Home_and_Kitchen_5,0,This is a great combo. Can't say enough about how well this works. Can cook 2 different items at once. Make chili and cornbread at the same time.
Home_and_Kitchen_5,0,"This is a nice looking, easy to read weather forecaster.  It's simple and not full of a 100 metrics like some of the other ones out there."
Home_and_Kitchen_5,0,Organises well. We did buy it for something else than it was intended for - to store dart supplies in our basement. Segments small odds and ends well.
Home_and_Kitchen_5,0,Depends on what you want to drink. If you are using for coffee there are better alternatives at a lot lower price. It is a good beer glass.
Home_and_Kitchen_5,0,"Great purchase.  Made my first pastry shell and pie; pastry shell was perfect. Note, however, that the blender's cleaner is not made to wipe the inner wires."
Home_and_Kitchen_5,0,"I USED THESE TO WASH MY WINDOWS AND WHAT SUPER NICE CLOTHS, NOT A BIT OF LINT AND SO HANDY AND WASHES UP GREAT... NOW MY WINDOW SPARKLE..."
Home_and_Kitchen_5,0,"Look as described, seal great and function as they should.  Nothing fancy, but if I drop it on my stove, they won't chip the ceramic flat top..."
Home_and_Kitchen_5,0,Beautiful bold color. Very soft. Sized perfectly. Wish it had the matching pillow shams. Washed in COLD water ~ no problem with color running or pilling of fabric.
Home_and_Kitchen_5,0,"These glasses make me happy. They are heavy and beautiful. They say not to put them in the dishwasher, but I do and they are fairing v. well."
Home_and_Kitchen_5,0,"Great item, good quality. Just they do not fit Whithmor mesh storage cubes, too big for them. I though that company suppose think about compatibility between own products."
Home_and_Kitchen_5,0,Large knife chipped the first time i used it.  I know that ceramic knives are more fragile but I was being very careful and it still chipped...
Home_and_Kitchen_5,0,Long time needed product that replaced a regular mitt. I have no problem holding pans fresh out the oven but that does not mean they're burn resistant obviously.
Home_and_Kitchen_5,0,I loved it until one of the sides broke from pushing down on it. But I ordered another one. It is not heavy duty though so slice carefully.
Home_and_Kitchen_5,0,"The Milkshake stays nice and cold in this, and feels like you're drinking a milkshake from an authentic fountain - a must have for milkshake or smoothie lovers!"
Home_and_Kitchen_5,0,"Love the look, but it's a little flimsy...though honestly, I suppose that's fair for the price! I'm returning this one and ordering a larger and higher quality version!"
Home_and_Kitchen_5,0,Love these bottles. Had a problem one was broken and the seller was easy to deal and replaced the broken bottle no problem. I would definitely buy again
Home_and_Kitchen_5,0,"Very nice 100% cotton sheets. I purchase based on listed as ""percale weave"", however packaging has no mention of this.  Will wash and hope they hold up."
Sports_and_Outdoors_5,1,Exactly what I was looking for. The quality is good and it fits my AR well.
Sports_and_Outdoors_5,1,"Great grip enhancement, really allows for an easy grip on a range bike."
Sports_and_Outdoors_5,1,Good and efective at 50% off.  Great value for the money!This is a
Sports_and_Outdoors_5,1,"This was a nice item, but I wouldn't recommend it to anyone who is a beginner."
Sports_and_Outdoors_5,1,"Item did not come with a set of straps, which I did not need for the bike. "
Sports_and_Outdoors_5,1,Never used it cause I had an issue with the latch closing after a few weeks.
Sports_and_Outdoors_5,1,Bought as a gift for my wife and she loves it.  She also loves the fact that
Sports_and_Outdoors_5,1,Great all-purpose ball.  Good for an emergency.  Not too hard to make a throw
Sports_and_Outdoors_5,1,Great jump rope! Love that it has a wide opening. I also love that it's been used
Sports_and_Outdoors_5,1,Bought this for my boyfriend and he loves it!  He also likes that it's been used
Sports_and_Outdoors_5,1,Comfortable & well designed. The ONLY thing I didn't like is the buckle.
Sports_and_Outdoors_5,1,The ladder does just the job. The only problem is that it comes with a small screw that is
Sports_and_Outdoors_5,1,Works nicely. could swivel it to the side and it works great.
Sports_and_Outdoors_5,1,Looks great on my wifes. I love the look and feel of this bat.
Sports_and_Outdoors_5,1,"Easy to pack, small, light, and easy to carry.  I will keep this bag in"
Sports_and_Outdoors_5,1,As always this company just doesn't make the best products for the money.  I have one and
Sports_and_Outdoors_5,1,Have been wearing this sock for a couple of weeks and I'm very happy with the fit and comfort
Sports_and_Outdoors_5,1,I like them and will buy more.I bought these for my husband who is a soccer fan.
Sports_and_Outdoors_5,1,Works pretty awesome in tandomest. The only problem is that it's kind of hard to put
Sports_and_Outdoors_5,1,Fantastic product and rock solid.  The only problem is that it comes with a small screw
Sports_and_Outdoors_5,1,Great way to work out.  I love the feel of the fabric.  The yellow is awesome
Sports_and_Outdoors_5,1,My daughter loves these as well. The only problem is that they are too small for her.
Sports_and_Outdoors_5,1,"These were easy to use and assemble, the materials are good and sturdy, and the handle fits the"
Sports_and_Outdoors_5,1,Product was incomplete. Order was shipped on time. Wife loved it. Nice bag.
Sports_and_Outdoors_5,1,Very warm. Dont like the smell of sweat. Wife loved it.
Sports_and_Outdoors_5,0,"I like this mask. It does what it's supposed to do, conceal your face. It's pretty comfortable to wear for long periods, it's not heavy so you won't sweat, and it doesn't interfere with your vision. Most of all I appreciate that it's breathable, and when I wear my glasses they don't fog up like they do with my fleece mask. Seems fairly well constructed and should last a long time. For the price, it's a great bargain."
Sports_and_Outdoors_5,0,"I love these towels ....use for pool, beach, and this past Aug. we used for our trip to Disney...it actually helped in 98 degrees to have the towel on your neck (like a scarf)...I totally recommend for outdoors.  As a swimmer, I recommend for the pool, as these things slough off most of the water from your body after being in pool, so you don't have to soak your towel before showering.......Note to self: they are awesome."
Sports_and_Outdoors_5,0,"I'm a female with a short bob haircut. This cap felt way too small, and I actually had a headache after wearing it for a few minutes. I will be giving this to my friend's daughter to use, as I don't see how the one I received can fit any adult's head. Speedo's spandex/poly stretch fit swim cap is much better, in my opinion. That one goes on/off easily and keeps your hair contained."
Sports_and_Outdoors_5,0,"Pleasantly surprised. First, when this bag came, I was not happy surprised, It was all done up in this small package. But once opening it and checking it out, it was pretty neat. I purchased it for my son. He has school and sports and always complains about bags and how heavy have so many can me. This bag is light, water proof and so far, the complaints have died down. So, kids happy, moms happy."
Sports_and_Outdoors_5,0,"I bought 3 of these. Took them out on the boat for the first time tonight. Two of the three broke within an hour. Still got the the fish in the boat, but I only came home with one. Sooooo be advised, they're pretty weak for bass fishing, but for a spincast reel and some light fishing for crappie or something they're probably fine. I don't blame Quantum. I blame my mantra. ""Set it like you got a pair"""
Sports_and_Outdoors_5,0,"BEST WATER BOTTLE EVER!!! You will NOT regret spending a pretty penny on this bad boy of water bottles. I have thrown all my other water bottles away becasue there is no need to anything else. My drink literally stays COLD; ICE COLD all day long! I'm not kidding. I didn't believe it would, but it really really does. The ice is barely melted by dinner after filling it with my ice and drink in the morning around 7!"
Sports_and_Outdoors_5,0,"Very pleased. it came well packaged in a nice box with graphics. This seat way exceeded my expectations, which were high. It looks more like a big piece of jewelry than a bike seat! Now I am just worried about it getting scratched! This is a case of getting much more than what you paid for, I can't recommend this higher! Pretty, pretty!! You don't always get what you pay for, sometimes you get more! 2 Big thumbs up!!!"
Sports_and_Outdoors_5,0,"Bought these for my 4 yr old son for jet skiing. I expected them to be too big because nobody seems to be able to make gloves for a little kid, but they are perfect! he loves them and they fit well. He has somewhat of a challenge getting them off and if you don't take them off right you will have to turn each finger right side out before wearing again, but its not that big of a deal!"
Sports_and_Outdoors_5,0,Looks like these things sill last as long as I do. Sand in my area really requires that you stand on it some. Placed two of them into ground and not all the way to stop then hammered in two PVC rod holders. One of the PVC rod holders fell over after a couple of hours and I almost lost a rod. The aluminum rod holders held fast ever use.  There is also a ruler on the sand spikes.
Sports_and_Outdoors_5,0,"6'1"", 159 pounds, cyclist build, ordered a Large. The jersey was nearly baggy but certainly wearable. The problem was with the bib shorts - the openings for the legs were so small making the shorts so tight to pull on that I fear the seams would rip within a couple rides. The shoulder strap material also isn't as robust as other similarly priced kits that I own. Mostly returning due to the size mismatch between the jersey and bib shorts."
Sports_and_Outdoors_5,0,"I've never owned a Buff, so I can't compare the quality, but I sure do love these little guys. They are easy to throw in a backpack and they come in very handy for hiking. I've used mine as a scarf, balaclava, headband, and hat. They go in the washer and dryer just fine. I don't see a reason to pay for a brand name when these seem to do the exact same thing at a fraction of the price."
Sports_and_Outdoors_5,0,Not really impressed with this at this point.  I have tried 4 times to get the analyzer to connect to the app without success.  To be fair we have done this right before practice so we did not spend a lot of time on it.  I will work on it at home where we have more time to spend trying to set it up and I will update this post if I can get it to work.
Sports_and_Outdoors_5,0,"I have purchased other cheaper versions from China, US and UK with plastic clasp and always found they are not real paracord, but plastic imitation paracord.  Having finally paid a decent price I now have a great quality item, and considering you buy this to one day possibly protect your life in an emergency, it seems stupid to scrimp on quality... This is a high quality product at the right price, so happy I bought more for my friends!!!!"
Sports_and_Outdoors_5,0,"Surprisingly strong feels like it's going to last quite awhile, probably will never need another one unless I loose this one. I work armed Security so I need to have a hand cuff key on me in case I need to arrest someone. I usually carry 4 keys on me but this one is the most convenient and easiest to get too when I need it. If you're a Cop, Security, Corrections, etc I would recommend you buy one of these."
Sports_and_Outdoors_5,0,My son is a surfer and we are on the move in our motorhome. This bag has come in super handy as we transport the surfboard all over the US. The bag is perfect on the Costco surfboard (I'm forgetting the name now - it's the popular one). Anyhow. it works great. it has had much time inside the RV and outside and so far holding up very good. the cost value is the BEST as other bags are so expensive!
Sports_and_Outdoors_5,0,These things are awesome! I teach fitness in doors and out doors and I can't always find something to attach my fitness bands to.  This makes it so much easier for my clients and for me. They are strong and durable.  I love that I can travel with them and that they come with a pouch to carry them in.  I did purchase these at a reduced fee for my positive review.  I'm very happy with them.
Sports_and_Outdoors_5,0,"Amazing, works great. its a little nosiy but not to bad. After prolonged use the unit does get warm, but my hands using get tired before then. I can not stress enough how much time this prep station saves me. Doing all 4 steps in a second or two means i do 1k round runs instead of 200 round runs in the same time. If i ever grow two more arms i will buy a second one. Would recommend to anyone."
Sports_and_Outdoors_5,0,"This is my second purchase for this basket. First purchased for myself but my hubby placed it on his bicycle he needed to use a basket. Since he needed it and like it, he told me to order another.. Yes it can move a bit but you can tie it down yourself using a bungee or a plastic tie just be creative. Hubby used our dog tether leash make it more secure.  Our Chihuahua loves to ride in the basket!"
Sports_and_Outdoors_5,0,"I have been addicted to using these during my glute workouts at the gym and have seen a big difference so I decided to order my own set. I plan to bring them with me when I travel. They are excellent quality, very durable. The resistance for each color is as specified and they come with a guide to teach you how to use them. If you hop onto Pinterest there is a large variety of resistance band workouts there as well."
Sports_and_Outdoors_5,0,The overall quality of this blade is astounding.  Buck never fails to deliver an awesome knife product.  This knife has quickly become my favorite hunting knife.  The feel of the blade in your hand is great.  It has good balance and is as sharp as a razor. I was even surprised at the high quality of leather sheath it comes with. One day when I'm old I will be passing this blade down to one of my children.
Sports_and_Outdoors_5,0,I use this for soda on the golf course and it keeps the ice out of the mouthpiece very well. having tohold the cap out of the way is kind of annoying but it is worth putting up with. It keeps the liquid cold for at least 5 hours as that is the length of time I am on the course and it is always cold at the finist of the round. It fits in the cup holders of most golf carts.
Sports_and_Outdoors_5,0,"Avoid this product at all costs.  First the laser is not centered.  After adjusting my sight, I was worse than I was before.  I loaded the round in a tube and rotated it and it doesn't stay centered.  Secondnthe battery life is less than 5 minutes.  I wasted my $ of two more sets of three batteries.  Either the ground is bad or the thingbis designed by terribly.  I requested a return, money terribly spent."
Sports_and_Outdoors_5,0,This tent is the best tent we have ever bought. We have even camped in a full blown storm with high winds off of a lake and it held up great didn't even leak a drop. Super easy set up. Built in liner so you don't have to worry if you can't get your truck bed spotless. We can fit a full size bed through the doorway so we use that instead of an airbed. Will use this brand in the future!
Sports_and_Outdoors_5,0,"The point of being 4"" deep is because the mat will be used for falls not just regular tumbling so this being as firm as a moveable beam is a huge problem and probably explains the difference in price. This isn't useable for the purpose. 3' across is also much smaller in person than it looks in the picture, really think about that...  It also appears that there's Velcro to attach them in the pictures and I got two without Velcro."
Sports_and_Outdoors_5,0,"I got these for my daughter-in-law who is a huge Cardinal's fan and a runner. She, unfortunately for her, lives in a family of equally strong Cub's fans. She absolutely loves these and put them on for an evening run yesterday in 90 degree temps. Absorbed sweat well. They are well made and washed in cold water and hand dried--held up and looked almost new. Great gift for a sports team fanatic no matter if they are Cubs, Cardinals or other team fans!"
Sports_and_Outdoors_5,0,"You will sweat! This suit is CA Prop compliant according to the manufacturer, so I ordered. I wear dry fit close underneath, and use with my spin bike. My goal is to drop some body fat before spring break, and I believe this suit will get me there based on the last three weeks of workouts. By the way, I'm 45 yrs old, and after eating one too many scoops of ice cream, this is my aggressive but safe way to slim down."
Electronics_5,1,"AS advertised, a new very nice set of speakers.  I will keep my review for a couple"
Electronics_5,1,No frills. Was the perfect fit for my laptop.Very good quality.Nice little speaker.
Electronics_5,1,"Quiet, good airflow. Love it. Works great, just as advertised."

Electronics_5,1,Decent quality. Looks good and looks good. Buy it. works great.
Electronics_5,1,Directions are confusing for setting up. The only way to set it up is to use the one
Electronics_5,1,A more moderate size surge protector. The only problem is that it's too small for my desk.

Electronics_5,1,"Great upgrade for a 2012 MacBook Pro, with the addition of a 64gb drive."
Electronics_5,1,I had this item less than a week ago and it has continued to work just fine.
Electronics_5,1,I was shocked by how small it was. It is small enough to fit in the pocket of my

Electronics_5,0,Works as advertised. It's a little small and feels fragile but gets the job done.
Electronics_5,0,Fit on my desk great. Sound is poor but that is what speakers are for.
Electronics_5,0,"Easy to install works perfectly, extended the range of my Wireless connection by 50 feet."
Electronics_5,0,Works great on my ps4! I would strongly recommend this! Working great still months later.
Electronics_5,0,"Excellent product, charged both batteries quickly, fits perfect and works the same as stock battery."
Electronics_5,0,was easy to set up and works as good or better than the TiVo control
Electronics_5,0,Works really good. Keep the usb 3.0 fast meaning it is real usb 3.0 cable.
Electronics_5,0,Bought the adapter to go with my extra charging cable. Worked well with Samsung cable.
Electronics_5,0,It works fine but the caps do not stay on very well. East to lose.
Electronics_5,0,Oops. Make sure you buy the right stylus for the right version of the Note.
Electronics_5,0,great love having the different ones especially because i loss one once in a while.
Electronics_5,0,right side of head phones just stopped working and the ear buds keep falling out.
Electronics_5,0,"Make sure you buy your display port cables, the monitors do not come with them."
Electronics_5,0,These keep my earbuds in place! It would be nice if they offered clear/white ones.
Electronics_5,0,great motherboard. stable as rock. running amd fx 8320 @ 4.4ghz stock vcore never freeze/errors
Electronics_5,0,It worked for a hour then died.  Replaced it with a different power brick.
Electronics_5,0,The heavy duty battery makes my hand held radio run longer with more options enabled.
Electronics_5,0,"its basic enough, its soo light you would know it has nothing built into it."
Electronics_5,0,A lot of nice pieces that come in handy when you're getting the best shot.
Electronics_5,0,Everything was as smooth as silk. Transaction... Delivery... Product well made and does the job.
Electronics_5,0,"Not for what it said, does not fit Samsung Galaxy s6 edge plus as stated."
Electronics_5,0,Not the easiest protector to install but once it's on you'll barely know it's there
Electronics_5,0,"Did not correctly fit my 20"" screen. If it fit I would have kept it."
Electronics_5,0,Was a great cord as long as it lasted.  It is not working now.
Electronics_5,0,"Works well, hurts your ears after an hour or so use is the only downside."
Electronics_5,0,"Had to get the drivers from an online link, but it works like a charm."

Movies_and_TV_5,0,Pretty much exactly what the title says.  Not really great on fight scene choreography.  Mostly just running from and trying to duck the flying guillotines.
Movies_and_TV_5,0,Lots of wonderful scenic footage of the Maine coast lines from south to north. Wish there was more narrative on the towns and regions that were covered.
Movies_and_TV_5,0,I won't say it was better than the original but it was an awesome remake that they updated perfectly. Almost exactly the same as the Schwarzenegger movie.
Movies_and_TV_5,0,"I saw this in the theatre when it was first released. Classic! For anyone who's done the work, it's worth watching and will be memorable for sure."
Movies_and_TV_5,0,I actually did not know that Rodan was a color film since it was that long ago since I've seen it. Loved watching these classic Kaiju movies.
Movies_and_TV_5,0,A+ Highly Recommend. Very fast turn around time and was in my mail box before I even realized it!  I would purchase from this person again!
Movies_and_TV_5,0,"I don't know what to tell you. this one I just am not sure about. I am of the fence didn't hate it, but didn't love it."
Movies_and_TV_5,0,Great movie. My grandson loves it. He is just 3 and sits through the whole movie. Plays with play swords and pretends he is in the movie.
Movies_and_TV_5,0,Great movie. I love old Egypt in Sci-fi. This movie has a very cool bad guy and continues the tradition of examining the politics of being different.
Movies_and_TV_5,0,"Brilliant adaptation!  The acting in all three of these films is wonderful.  If you get a chance, check this out, you will not be disappointed."
Movies_and_TV_5,0,It was slow and I did not feel like it tied things up well. I was very surprised because each actress is wonderful in their own right.

Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5,0,This is great for heat gun (SMA) applications.  The RMA flux is great for unsoldering the old parts and getting a clean pad;  RMA flux is mildly reactive which increases the wettability of metals .  Most SMA jobs are usually small so this is a lot of product for type of application.
Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5,0,"After having bought a seat from our local super center, we took a chance on buying one sight unseen! I am so glad we did! This is a top quality seat, attractive hardware, and not much more can be said about a toilet seat! Worth the money, and can throw out the junk bought previously!"
Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5,0,"This sharpening system worked perfectly for me out of the box.  The directions were slim, but this is a common system with information on the web about it.  I've found it to be heavy duty, with nice welds, paint and locking mechanisms.  For the price I think it is an excellent value."
Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5,0,Installed it myself. It works great. I really like it when I can go to my phone or computer and change the temperature when I am away from the house. It also sends me texts or e-mails when the temperature goes above or below a programed temp that I selected.
Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5,0,Beautiful quality product. I gave a 3-star rating only because these lights have to be wired into power source and can NOT be used with a cord and adapter as the description says. Even the instructions in the box say can't be used with cord. Buy it only if you can hard wire it in.
Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5,0,"Holy cow! This thing makes my MagLite into a light saber! I had a Nite-Ize led in my light and I dropped the light, breaking the old LED. I did a little research, found this. It is roughly twice as bright as the old Nite-Ize piece of crap. I am very happy with my purchase."
Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5,0,"I am very happy with these glasses. I bought them for my 12 year old son when he is shooting airsoft guns and archery. He likes these so much better than other safety glasses because they are very clear and aren't too big on his face. And for safety glasses, they look better than most."

Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5,0,I inherited a 6 gallon compressor and a couple of air houses from a family member.  I'm guessing they are about 10 year old.  All of the fittings were leaking air pretty badly to the point where the compressor was almost always running.  I replaced the fittings with these and couldn't be happier.
Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5,0,"Is it super powerful like a $100 drill? No, but it is perfect for 95% of what people do around the house with a drill. I have hung a large flat screen, built a water filtration system, and put up lots of wall decorations thus far on its first charge. Great little drill for the price."
Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5,0,"The old 5000V 30mA outdoor transformer died after 20 years.  The sign though is indoors.  This product worked GREAT as a replacement and the pull chain on/off is a really nice added feature.  This is a 10,000V BTW but will work for older 5000V signs.  We are all lit back up now."
Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5,0,"This sprayer does what it should, but it's made from very slick coated plastic so hard to handle with soapy hands.  Plus the hose is molded plastic rather than a metal sheath so doesn't want to lose the kinks inflicted in packaging so far.  But for the money I would recommend it without hesitation."
Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5,0,"This little gadget was my last attempt at painting a difficult to reach area over the stairs before paying a painter hundreds of dollars to finish what I started.

Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5,0,"This keeps the garage tidy by keeping the bikes upright. But it doesn't fit bikes with disc brakes very well. Just a little more room, a dip in the bar, whatever, would have made these much better to not mess up my discs. Aside from that, assembly was easy, and it seems very sturdy and durable."
Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5,0,"It is pretty thin stuff.  Is not the heavy duty tarp you are used to.  But then again have had it out covering my wood pile for a long time now and seems to be as strong and water proof as day one.  So, I would say for the price I am satisfied!"
Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5,0,"I love this vent fan. The only sound I hear is the sound of moving air. I did replace an existing fan and I replaced it on the ceiling side. I installed additional framing and mounted it from below. Yes. It was a lot more work than mounting it from above but, it certainly can be done."
Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5,0,"I was leery at first because the past Little Giant ladders I tried were just too heavy to be functional for me.  This is the perfect 6 foot ladder.  It is lite weight, stable and the platform and design make it one of the best ladders ever used.  I highly recommend it to anyone."
Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5,0,"this stuff is great.....my stair noses are solid without additional hardware.  used leftover flooring to make doggie stairs (sans nails/screws).  they could hold a much bigger dog than my 17 lb 'er.

Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5,0,I thought my metal table top was ready to use after one day of drying.  Wrong!  Cure time is 7 days!  I have use this product on other outdoor metal furniture.

Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5,0,"I used to use a $1000 Lamello biscuit joiner when I worked in a cabinet shop. The dealt works amazingly well for how much it costs.

Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5,0,"I have the h600w and the h600 and if you have a chance, get the h600 instead, it is quite a bit brighter and the white light is much easier to see with then the yellow light that the h600w puts out.

Pet_Supplies_5,1,135lb 9mo Leonberger FINALLY an African Grey and the vet recommended this collar.
Pet_Supplies_5,0,Great little filter! keeps my table top 2 gallon sparkling clean. The fish and plants are doing great with this filter.  It was very inexpensive and was shipped really fast. Would absolutely recommend this little filter who had a small tank or bowl to keep the water moving!
Pet_Supplies_5,0,These work really good for dogs that like to pull. Takes a little bit of time for the dog to get used to it but use lots of treats and positive reinforcement. With this on your dog will not be able to pull you around on the leash anymore.
Pet_Supplies_5,0,"Well, the dogs seem to like them, although once they start chewing on them, there are sharp edges that have cut my pup's mouth.  The odor is awful, but maybe the dogs like that.  The price is too high for the amount of time that they last."
Pet_Supplies_5,0,"I used to just use a plastic bag to pick up the dog poop in my backyard, but it was killing my back. I went ahead and bought this about 6 months ago and will never go back. The product works great even with the tall grass, highly recommend!"
Pet_Supplies_5,0,"The thing about these is that the hood doesn't leave much room for the dog's neck to move around. It's similar to the idea of actual hoodies for people... some hoodies are loose fitting and comfortable. Others are a bit restraining, such as these. But they are very cute."
Pet_Supplies_5,0,"This is a great harness for dogs that need adjustment around the neck, like my little dog.  Very few dog harnesses do that, only one adjustment around their body, and that's all.  These are great, and will buy more in the future for sure.  Thanks seller."
Pet_Supplies_5,0,"Awesome product. so glad I bought this for my tank. I cleaned my tank the other day so easily thanks to this great product!! I'll be letting my friends with fish tanks know about this great product. I love the pump, no more sucking it to start the flow."
Pet_Supplies_5,0,"These water buffalo tails are very much loved by my little Maltese. They provide quite a bit of chewing fun for him, and appear to be good quality (sorry but I was not willing to taste). There are quite a few in the sack, so pretty good value here."
Pet_Supplies_5,0,"With this, I can really get good distance on our fetch game. My dog is pretty fit and throwing short distances gets tiring for my arm because the dog brings the ball back so quickly. This gives my arm a break and the dog a longer run."
Pet_Supplies_5,0,"I guess you really do get what you pay for!  These pads were inexpensive compared to some others and I won't buy them again because they are ""too"" thin and the pet urine leaks right through.  I use them with my sturdier pads most of the time."
Pet_Supplies_5,0,"Great bed. Liked it so much I ordered another one for when she stays with my parents. Well made, ease to clean and my dog loves it. I have a 65 pound yellow lab and she fits on the medium 30 X 42 just perfect with room to roll."
Pet_Supplies_5,0,"I like this bottle. We can both get a drink. The only thing is that they might want to do something with the doggie cup. I find my dog struggling to get a drink sometimes because of the high back on the cup. Other than that, it's a good cup."
Pet_Supplies_5,0,"I like it.  It's healthy for my Sam.  And delivered with no extra charge right to the door.  It's not any less expensive per can than at Tractor Supply but I don't have to stop and get it -- and so far, it's never out of stock."
Pet_Supplies_5,0,"WOW.....Finally a harness for my full coated Lhasa Apso that doesn't cause matting....YAY!!!!!!!! Comfy, easy to put on...The greatest find for people who keep their long haired dogs full coated.....no more hacking up there fur because we can't find the right harness for them....THANK YOU.......Sunny and Molly the beautiful Lhasa"
Pet_Supplies_5,0,This toy exceeded my expectations.  It's great to add some kibble and some smaller treats.  My pup rolls it around with his notes and sometimes bats at it with his paws.  It keeps him busy for several minutes.  Cleaning is easy as it folds inside out.
Pet_Supplies_5,0,Seems bright on max and at that level should work well for plants.  But the 24/7 option is ridiculous.  You'll have light on your tank for like 16 hours at some level or another and half the time the light is dim.  Cant beat the price though.
Pet_Supplies_5,0,"I bought this collar for dog walks after dark during the winter months. I have a white dog and would have to say that the dog is more reflective than the collar unfortunately. It seems durable, however I don't feel the dog is much more visible when we use it."
Pet_Supplies_5,0,"The collar did come as ordered.  The gold stitching is actually mustard yellow; I probably should have inquired more about that as I truly wanted gold stitching.  Other than that, the blue collar is great and the name and phone number, very vivid easy to read for sure!"
Pet_Supplies_5,0,"I just keep this on the floor and when my cat is feeling frisky he will carry it around everywhere lol.  It's cute, but I think a little pouch for catnip would have really got the cats going.  Overall they play with it so it works for me."
Pet_Supplies_5,0,Dog LOVES these!  He was eating them too quickly so I purchased the ball that holds the treats.  He has been working on the ball for 3 days now and he is not nagging me to go anywhere.  I think we are all happy with this product!
Pet_Supplies_5,0,I absolutely love this harness for my Yorkies. So nicely made and pretty! I always used harnesses on them and I really LOVE how this one fits and looks. It is not cheaply made like some I have purchased in the stores. Im ordering another one for my other yorkie.
Pet_Supplies_5,0,I got this for my baby bunny sice she outgrew her Savic Sputnic. She doesn't like traditional hides and likes to be elevated off the ground. I'm not sure how long it will last because she's been chewing on it all day but so far she seems to enjoy it!
Pet_Supplies_5,0,Very high quality and great price. I recommend them however you need to start when your dog is young-- we bought to distract our older dog when he barks at every little thing the clicker doesn't phase him. But the product is really high quality and we did keep them
Pet_Supplies_5,0,"This is a nice plant. It has a good solid base that keeps it well-anchored in the gravel, and it looks quite real. However,  I  think it would have been cheaper to buy it in the store than purchasing it online, since they do occasionally go on sale."
Pet_Supplies_5,0,"Fat and juicy.  Great for my RES's.  I use these to supplement their diet.  Note, these things don't float, so they are fed these on their basking pad.  This ensures my turtles are eating them and not becoming more junk for the filters to pick up."
Pet_Supplies_5,0,"Even though I measured my dog before purchasing this harness and bought the recommended size, I cannot get the front straps (where the least clips in) to be small enough to fit his body. He can fully get out of it and this is incredibly dangerous. I want a full refund!"

Kindle_Store_5,0,"Like most work of Jody Picoult, I enjoyed this book. There is a great story with believable characters even if somewhat unconventional."
Kindle_Store_5,0,Other than the Discworld series I cannot think of a funnier more entertaining series of novels. Read the entire series and enjoy.
Kindle_Store_5,0,"Don't know what I was expecting, but this small book touched me.  Thank you, Joshua Graham, for this. I needed it."

Kindle_Store_5,0,Delete it quickly and save yourself the time wasted even overusing this really bad romance novel.  proves anyone can write trash
Kindle_Store_5,0,This story has a real and humorous theme.......well written as are all of Bobby Hutchinson's books.  You will really enjoy it.
Kindle_Store_5,0,The first two books were great....book three....not so much....it was pretty slow...with almost no tension. I would have left it at two.
Kindle_Store_5,0,I laughed and cried though this book. It kept my interest all the though. I Will be reading more of your books.
Kindle_Store_5,0,Interesting at best. Lot of truth to this book. Would recommend it to others. Once I started reading I could not stop
Kindle_Store_5,0,Book 2 in this fantastic series..it's just great. Love this one as much as the first one. Can't wait to continue on!
Kindle_Store_5,0,Now she not only does Suzie have her hands full with Brendon's controlling ways but now she has a stalker in Graham.

Kindle_Store_5,0,Well written! I enjoyed it very much and will read more by I H Laking. Intriguing new steampunk  world and characters.

Kindle_Store_5,0,Each of the books had its own flair and kept me thoroughly engrossed. I enjoyed the variety of characters and story lines.
Kindle_Store_5,0,I highly recommend Hooked! It's not your typical romance.  It's well written and gets you sucked in from the first page!
