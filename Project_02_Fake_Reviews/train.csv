Sports_and_Outdoors_5,1,Really really bright! Fits on my Glock 20 perfectly!Very good quality.
Sports_and_Outdoors_5,1,it's a weight belt and it has the wide brim. I also love that it's removable and
Sports_and_Outdoors_5,0,"My 14 y.o. really wanted this for Xmas.  She was so excited when she open this gift.  We finally got enough snow to go skiing the other day- she has no complaints and loves the style.  It comes with extra padding to personalize the fit, plus a dial in the back to adjust size.  It's just what she wanted!"
Sports_and_Outdoors_5,0,"I don't know how anyone could have a hard time mounting these tires. It took me about 90 seconds without the use of any tools. Some of the reviewers here need to work on some finger strength. My youngest grandson is 8 years old, if he couldn't mount one of these tires in less than 5 minutes I would have to disown him."
Sports_and_Outdoors_5,0,"This is a ditto on the previous review.  Bought it at Walmart.  Installed it , did not work as advertised.  I had to hold the receiver no further than 6 inches from the transmitter.  I too though it could be the batteries so I bought two fresh ones with the same result.  I am contacting the manufacturer on Monday."
Sports_and_Outdoors_5,0,This has worked well for me.  It does exactly what it's advertised to do and seems well-constructed.  I've had mine for well over a year now and it's still going strong.  Used exclusively for taking hot soups to the office for lunch - I've never used it for coffee but expect that it would perform just as well for that purpose.
Sports_and_Outdoors_5,0,"Just add belt and go, whether you are shooting for fun at the range ( if holstering is allowed) or maybe in a local event, this is beyond a doubt one of the best complete packages out there.  Select the correct rig for your specific gun.  Receive your set, add a belt and go convert money into recoil, noise, fire and fun."
Sports_and_Outdoors_5,0,"These tube baits have been my GO TO baits for 10 years.  Been having trouble finding these lately and I have noticed Zoom has changed the plastic blend.  These are now heavily salted and resemble other brands of tube.  The old blend was a better, softer bait.  I do know I paid way too much money from this Amazon supplier."
Sports_and_Outdoors_5,0,"I always have a knife on me. However, working at a financial institution, people look at you funny when you pull out a knife (especially the ones i carry, kershaw blur, benchmade griptilian, etc.). So I wanted a nice light knife with a slim profile that wouldn't attract too much attention. This does the job great. Awesome blade, no blade play and handsome design."
Sports_and_Outdoors_5,0,"Good fit and they do a good job.  I have been using them for awhile now and like them very much.  I was afraid they might interfere with hearing ordinary conversation on the range, but I can still hear others on the range OK, and they reduce the gun fire noise to a level that will protect your hearing. Very comfortable too."
Sports_and_Outdoors_5,0,"These tubes are nearly impossible to accidentally puncture, but they fail in the 12-1/2 x 2-1/4"" size because the stems are straight rubber.  I tried to use them on a Trikke 12, and all of the stems tore after multiple refillings, since they have to be bent outward to attach a pump.  What good is an indestructable tube with fragile valve stem?"
Sports_and_Outdoors_5,0,"This is a beautiful mat. Item as described and fast shipping. I put this matt to the test and it passed with a 100%. I practice hot yoga a few times a week and I sweat alot. I didn't need my yoga mat towel. The top layer has a grip that increases with moisture which is perfect for me. No sliding, no towel bunching up."
Sports_and_Outdoors_5,0,"These are a perfect compliment to the S&W M&P. The stock sights on the M&P are very good but these made picking up the sight picture so much easier. The installation was easy and only took 15 minutes. The dots are bight and easy to pick up. The price was great, these are Trijicons. If you have an M&P you cannot go wrong getting these."
Sports_and_Outdoors_5,0,"This water bottle is great for little kids who are active.  We got the Contigo Trekker bottle which holds 14 oz, but noticed that my son was running out of water by just a bit.  I only wish they made this size for kids, in the stainless steel fashion, since it keeps the drink cooler, longer.  But overall it's a great product!"
Sports_and_Outdoors_5,0,"Awesome Kayak and great color.  have fished in bays and offshore towards rigs.  Handled all conditions great, did notice some water in hull when taken offshore however did not affect performance, and would not hesitate to go offshore in it again.  Kayaked out next to guys in hobies, and watched most of them flip while I cruised passed them in crashing waves."
Sports_and_Outdoors_5,0,I have a big head and I always wear either a Buff UVX Mask (hot weather) or Force Field Motorcycle Mask (cold weather) to protect my face from the elements. This is the first helmet Ive owned that is large enough fit my head and mask with room to spare. Not having that slight pressure in your noggin makes such a big difffence.
Sports_and_Outdoors_5,0,"this is the smallest pump I have ever used. I pumped couple 'puffs' in to my bike and it worked like a charm. the pin that came with it was a blessing. I pumped air in to my football and again job was very well done. cant ask for more at this price. I hope it withstands time-test, I have a feeling that it will!"
Sports_and_Outdoors_5,0,"Yoga blocks are amazing tools for yogi's of all levels! I was so excited to find some purple ones as well because most of my yoga props and mats are purple. As an aspiring yoga instructor i like to be prepared for others who join me in my yoga practice, in case they don't have their own. These are a perfect addition to my collection!"
Sports_and_Outdoors_5,0,"I have two Tumi laptop bags....SOO LONG!! This bag is amazing. GREAT construction and compartment arrangement. Only downfall is a 'luggage slip' to attach over/to roller bag handles, but I'll manage given all the other great features. I carry two medium size laptops (13""-15"") and accessories with no issues. The bottle holders on each end are handy, one is slightly larger in diameter than the other."
Sports_and_Outdoors_5,0,I don't like the fact that its so tight and my hair still gets soaked. I get done swimming and my forehead has lines across it that the cap leave. Like for or 5 lines and the indentation stays for a few hours after the fact. I teach swim so in the pool for hours at a time would love a product that does not leak.
Sports_and_Outdoors_5,0,"Seems to be a very durable tube. If your bike pump has the adapter that screws onto a valve, be careful removing once inflated because this tubes valve comes apart, and can attach itslef to pump adapter. Happened to me, and I thought it was a faulty product, but screwed valve back on and inflated with another pump. Seems durable. Hope it lasts a long time!"
Sports_and_Outdoors_5,0,"The UTG High Profile Airgun Rings work well on the Daisy 853 with a UTG 3-9 x 32 BugBuster Scope.  I was happily impressed with the sight quality of this scope.  The cross-hairs are fine enough to see the period, also known as the 10 dot on the 10 meter air rifle target.  Now if I was only steady enough to hit it."
Sports_and_Outdoors_5,0,Great product. My old grip hurt my fingure when I fired it as this grip goes on my 410ga pistol. The new grip eliminated that problem and much more comfortable to shoot. Not my first itm from Hogue and as always the item is perfect for me. All Aces here and would recommend Hogue Products to everyone looking for and upgrade. Thanks again. All Aces Here.
Sports_and_Outdoors_5,0,This is a very good Set of resistance band for home workout or to add intensity on your gym workout by using the bands as variable weight and tension for your exercise. Quality is good and it comes with nice attachments if you want to use it at home. Overall for the price it is a good bargain and a must to have for home fitness.
Sports_and_Outdoors_5,0,I filled this little guy up with waterproof matches and have to say that the capacity is relatively small but this is only a backup fire source. I feel much more at ease carrying this as a back up along with my matching Exotac nanoStriker! The best part is that this piece is made in the USA so you know that your receiving a quality product.
Sports_and_Outdoors_5,0,"For what I paid $16 it was totally worth it. In fact, if you HAVE to pay retail, this is probably the most rugged wedge pack for the price. It holds a lot more than one might think and it sits tight underneath the seat without any hanging or interference with the back tire at all. I would buy again if the quality is the same."
Sports_and_Outdoors_5,0,"I've been very happy with these canteens. I have a filter that I used for long, multi-day hikes, but it only came with a bag that was 16 ounces. These bags are the same gauge as the filter, and they are much larger that the bag that came with it. This helps me have more confidence in my supply of water while I'm on backpacking trips."
Sports_and_Outdoors_5,0,"Nice little Aerator for small areas,would probably only use it for bait,NOT meant for Bass Tournament Quality,as this pumps air into the livewell or tank it is not OXYGEN which fish need to stay alive and healthy,(if you were in a tournament and had 5 Large/Smallmouth Bass in a livewell and this was the only thing running,chances are they will not be alive at weigh in time)"
Sports_and_Outdoors_5,0,I use these at the shooting range and they're just OK. They don't seem to be 29 reduction but I don't know that I can tell that much difference. I like that they fold and they seem to hold up well but they are not as effective as others I have used. I often use foam earplugs instead because those don't interrupt my sighting on my stock.
Sports_and_Outdoors_5,0,"The yellow is bold the Packer's emblem is bold and it sticks away from the hat. The fit is true (according to the other hats I've purchased) and it is well made. This was a gift and the girl loved it. It's a nice mix between a classic NFL emblem and those crazy, over the top 'loud' hats that kids seam to like. Overall a nice hat."
Sports_and_Outdoors_5,0,"I was debating between the 10"" or 14"". Decided on this... Take it out the box, remove the cardboard, wipe off the factory grease, don't cut yourself, and you've now got the best hiking/camping knife made. Anything longer and you will lose the perfect balance and the thickness (strength). This straps perfectly to a molle web backpack with enough room to adjust, anything longer would be overkill."
Sports_and_Outdoors_5,0,"I bought this on the recommendation of a youtube video producer named Iraqveteran8888.  He said that a 20GA bore brush and some of this cleaning compound on the end of a drill would get the bolt to stop sticking on my Mosin Nagant 91/30, and he was dead on.  After cleaning the chamber with this compound it cleared up the problem I was having perfectly."
Sports_and_Outdoors_5,0,I think depending on a few factors the amount of pressure in these sprays is inconsistent. Between my training partner and me we have four from this company and this style. I have a pink and one in black. He has both in black. Each one had had different strength of pressure. We still carry them for loose dog situations but quality control seems not top notch.
Sports_and_Outdoors_5,0,"Well, not ""I' exactly.  I bought these for my son who has a hobby where he needs flint.  These flints are a little pricey but my son says they are the best.  All I know is you best be careful when handling them.  They may look like a rock but they are very sharp.  My son is extremely pleased with this product."
Sports_and_Outdoors_5,0,"Good quality and perfect size of 40"" for my Ruger M77 compact rifle that's 36"". Heavy zipper, extra cargo pockets and a Ruger logo to match my rifle. I thought that all of Allen's cases were made in the USA, but this one has a ""Made in China"" tag sewn into it. I'm docking one star for not being American made. Still, it's a nice durable case."
Sports_and_Outdoors_5,0,"A must have for any Glock owner considering replacing their own sights. Works as it should. All metal and has adequate grip surface. I'd give it 5 stars since it does what it should, but it is fairly crude machining and the TRUGLO on mine is barely visible (but that's OK) Just an example of sorta crude construction. For $10 bucks you probably shouldn't expect a nice finish."
Sports_and_Outdoors_5,0,"Once again, for the $1.99 these are fine BUT the real negative in my opinion, is the fact that the end is crimped in and will not stay in forever..Other than that I'm really happy with this brush. The bristles seem to be really sturdy and have held up over the past 3 cleanings. Content with them and will continue to use and purchase. Thanx and God bless."
Sports_and_Outdoors_5,0,"Works okay. The pistol is very hard to cock. The rifle shootsway off sights and there is no way to make it more accurate. I have woodpeckers that decide to take up residence from time to time. It is close enough to frighten them, but not close enough to hit one for a lasting lesson. They are usually about 60 feet away, so this is some serious inaccuracy."
Sports_and_Outdoors_5,0,I can barely get two or three targets to set before shooting the third or forth makes them fall back down.......It is what it is....not a bad target to shoot pellets at and at least you get some movement and noise. I'm shooting at it with a .22 caliber Beeman Silver Kodiak X2 at around 800 FPS .....25 yards....and it had dented and distorted the targets pretty bad.
Sports_and_Outdoors_5,0,"Nice solid construction. Heavy duty cable, easily long enough to lock both tires around a telephone pole or tree.  Lock doesn't seem pickable by using that ""pull and turn"" method.  No play between dials.  Easy to re-set combo.  Good for a relatively safe area where you don't expect bike thieves with bolt cutters to be on the prowl.  I am happy with it."
Sports_and_Outdoors_5,0,I ordered 2 and they don't work and have to be sent back. I'm baffled because they were in original box and perfect looking shape.  I have the exact light for a year and know how to charge it and all so that's  not the problem but something is wrong with the 2 I ordered. When my current light works I will give it 5 stars
Sports_and_Outdoors_5,0,"Follow directions closely.  When used properly it assures a positive seal, patch, repair.  Can be used on neoprene, though its best suited for tri-lam drysuit repairs or to attach latex seals to a suit.  I save the cotol for in-field repairs when faster drying times are needed.  The working time is shortened when using this, so greater care must be taken in the repair."
Sports_and_Outdoors_5,0,Let me start off by saying I'm a guy that buys a lot of holsters I have over 7 different holsters and let me tell you this is by far the best holster I have ever bought it is the most comfortable fair price fits perfect sometimes I forget I even have it on I absolutely love this thing if I can give it 10 Stars I would
Sports_and_Outdoors_5,0,"Made for the Beretta recoil shooting vest, not for other use. One or two pads fit the vest fine and they definitely absorbs most of the recoil from a high-caliber rifle, but  I doubled up my pads to be sure. I often shoot at the range 100 rounds or so, and the Beretta Vest with two of these pads saves me pain and probably joint damage. Fully satisfied."
Sports_and_Outdoors_5,0,"Really nice, solid worth every cent. Have given a few of these are presents and EVERYONE goes on and on about how nice they are. High quality and something you will be happy to own. They are about as big as a sliver dollar so you can put them in a clear coin holder if you like to sane wear and tear and to keep it nice and shiny."
Sports_and_Outdoors_5,0,These roasting forks are awesome!  Great for all sizes of foods; marshmallows to large sausages.  The rotating and telescoping functions are wonderful.  The length is great for our small back yard fires up to bonfires on the beach.  We had a reason to contact the company and they handled our inquiry quickly.  I would definitely recommend this to others and have already done so!
Sports_and_Outdoors_5,0,I love the light and the fact that it can easliy be removed. I also really like the idea of the mount. Unfortunatley the mount doesn't works so well. It fits great but the lever that keeps it tight will not stay closed. This means it won't stay tight. Fixed it with a rubber band. I'm going to keep it because I think the light is really well made.
Sports_and_Outdoors_5,0,"This thing is great. Keeps ice cold ALLLLL DAY, even while drinking from it. They have a different cap design so you can drink out of it like a mug. No condensation rings on the furniture or the desk (to destroy your papers, books or magazines) either. Don't put carbonated beverages in it though, because you'll end up with a mess all over the place when you open it."
Sports_and_Outdoors_5,0,"This was bought to replace a broken flip lid from the Hydro Flask (which I have to say is a fantastic product and probably the best flask we have used!). Anyway, thanks to high desert winds, the flask was blown off the table and cracked. This replacement fits just as the original does plus it's a more exciting colour than the boring black version that the original came with!"
Sports_and_Outdoors_5,0,"I've had lots of fitbit replacement bands, usually in bright colors I'm not so thrilled with. This set is wonderful because it goes well with my professional wardrobe, without being basic black. The burgundy one is a bit darker than it appears in the picture. It's the exact shade of my favorite purple sweater. The gold and blue also coordinate well with several outfits. These have held up well."
Sports_and_Outdoors_5,0,These bands are great replacements. I have the 10 pack and am still on the first one! The band is a nice texture and very comfortable to wear. I think this band has last longer than the original band that came with the watch! The only draw back is having to buy the little strap to keep the snap closed with separately. Other than that I love the bands
Sports_and_Outdoors_5,0,"Unless you know already how to hula hoop, buy a larger one. I give this 5 stars because I made the mistake of buying a small one. But again, if you can hula already, this is nicely weighted and will work you out. If you CANNOT hula hoop (aren't very good) buying a larger one will be better for you. Yes, that's confusing logic but any hooper will confirm it."
Sports_and_Outdoors_5,0,"This rope is 30ft long and is thin, reflective and lightweight and packs up small. However, the biggest negative for me, and one of the reasons I don't use it much, is because it tangles up so easily. The reflective tape they have woven into the rope makes it tangle even easier than it normally would without the reflective material. But for $12, I'm not going to complain too much."
Sports_and_Outdoors_5,0,"I should have read more carefully.  Product is as described.  It fit my pool table well.  It is thinner than I would like.  I would like to have something heavier on my table before putting on the ping pong top (i.e. something with more protection).  Since it is ""thin"", it is easy on and easy off which is a good thing.  Color is great."
Sports_and_Outdoors_5,0,"I was disappointed with this Frankford Arsenal bullet puller...the one I got broke within 2 minutes of use and had to return for another...also, I don't like having to change out the collets depending on the caliber of bullet you are reclaiming..I should have stayed with the one collet RCBS hammer I had to start with...I gave it to a friend and choose to try a new one..shame on me."
Sports_and_Outdoors_5,0,"I liked the case,but the green color was not as bright as online. It was more of a lighter green and I wanted a brighter green. Just a matter of preference. Also,it was smaller than I thought. It didn't look as if it could hold much,not that you should pack as if going on  vacation,but I'm just saying! So,with that,I returned it. Other than that,it was a nice small bag."
Sports_and_Outdoors_5,0,"Great lite weight outdoor convertible pant. They meet all my needs for camping, hiking, everyday wear or just lounging. They have held up to 32 consecutive days of camping with no damage or staining that would come out in the wash. Had one of the upper pocket form a opening from a stitch that was not properly lock stitched. I rate them a ten out of ten. And will buy more!"
Sports_and_Outdoors_5,0,"Great inexpensive multi-tool set, with a variety of hexagonal tools, including a large 8mm version. There are also Shimano and Mavic wrenches included. The chain breaker is also a nice addition not found on many all-in-one bike tools. The EyezOff is built with good quality for a $15 multi-tool, and each tool deploys and retracts back into the case easily. This is a very versatile bike tool at a great price."
Sports_and_Outdoors_5,0,"The outer shell works great, has lots of roomy pockets, does the job of keeping the wind and rain/snow out. But it is the detachable inner shell that really makes this shine. It is the warmest jacket I have. I have worn it quite a bit this past winter by itself. It is very light weight, but as soon as I put it on, the winter cold just seems to disappear."
Sports_and_Outdoors_5,0,The description says these socks are seamless - they absolutely are not.  I had a big seam going down every toe which caused constant rubbing.  These socks are so uncomfortable and rubbed my toes/toe webbing so much that I had to take them off after 20 minutes of use (my toes are now sore).  I *highly* recommend you pass on these socks - I will be returning mine.
Sports_and_Outdoors_5,0,I commute to work and this is the best light I have ever owned.  The high beam seems more than enough for me to ride a paved forest preserve trail in the pitch black.  I had to lower the power when I hit the neighborhood streets. On driver stopped to talk to me saying I was blinding him with my light.  I now keep the beam pointed lower.
Sports_and_Outdoors_5,0,"I have a MOAB 10 bag that I use as my bug out bag, and as fantastic as it is, there are still times that I trouble getting all of my gear inside the bag, or securely attached to the Molle webbing.  That was until I found these tactical T-Rings.  They are well built and the quality is self evident upon review.  And they work great!  Recommended!"
Sports_and_Outdoors_5,0,"I've been wearing this suit for about two and a half months swimming in a school pool for aout half an hour 2-3 days a week (rinsing thoroughly after with tap water and hand washing once a week) and the material is wearing thin, sorry to have to look for a replacement so soon, but it was a great starter suit while I decided whether I would stick with the swimming!"
Sports_and_Outdoors_5,0,"Needed to add camo to my single shot 12 ga. for turkey season. The pattern didn't look like my jacket, which is also Realtree, but was random and camouflaged it nicely. Being a gun that was handed down to me I didn't want to damage it and the Camo Form kept the briars from scratching the finish. IF IT GETS WET TAKE IT OFF,LET THE CAMO FORM DRY AND CLEAN THE GUN!"
Sports_and_Outdoors_5,0,"For anyone who rides a bike, this is necessary!  Some days I ride for over 3-4 hours and these Padded Shorts helps.  Without these shorts, I would not want to ride more than an hour.  I ride a mountain bike with a specially made seat for men...but these shorts are still needed.  I had these for over 4 years now and still going strong.  I highly recommend."
Sports_and_Outdoors_5,0,"Using mine for months constant 24/7 and its still awesome! The majority of low reviews are because they give kids these things to chew on, how about teach your kids not to chew or bite the mouthpiece instead of ripping on a well designed product made for adults. Give your kids the sippy cups they obviously still need! Another idea would be to teach then to use teeth for chewing not drinking!"
Sports_and_Outdoors_5,0,It is okay for a tent. I dislike how there are no window covers on the sides. You basically need to use the tarp for privacy. This doesn't work well when you're camping in a Texas winter and only need privacy for a second to change clothes. I disliked how it stated it was on a huge sale for prime day when really that is the normal price on any other day.
Sports_and_Outdoors_5,0,"As others have commented, it's convenient to be able to mount two cages and be able to grab either bottle from the same side while riding. The cage and mounting bracket are two parts, held (firmly) together by the cage bolts (on your bike, not shipped with the cage). Much more attractive than the old standby aluminum cages, at about the same price. Holds a 20oz Powerade or Gatorade bottle just right."
Sports_and_Outdoors_5,0,"I purchased the Flitz gun/knife care kit to clean the finish on my 2 month old $3,000 pistol. The polish is advertized to be safe on ""factory hot gun bluing"". After polishing the finish on my firearm using the polish and a wiping t-shirt I noticed the finish was coming off. I just could not believe it. Because of FLITZ I am now going to have an extremely large repair bill."
Sports_and_Outdoors_5,0,"I'm very happy to have made the switch from head scarf/sweat band to GUTR. Comes with easy adjustments for larger or smaller head sizes. Very comfortable...don't even know you have it on. Definitely keeps the sweat out of my face and eyes. On occasion of a really, really hot day, I have to remember to tilt my head to the side to empty gutter of sweat or it will get in my eyes."
Sports_and_Outdoors_5,0,"The design of this Poncho is better than U.S. Military issue: It has snaps that create sleeves for your arms making it easier to do things without the rain seeping in. However, it still functions well as a small tarp. The quality is good and it is very light weight and compact, even if the camo looks a little weird; after having for a while, I'm getting where I kind of like it."
Sports_and_Outdoors_5,0,The whole Zombie Line is great and includes black scales. This is more of a gardening design that with it's thickness can cut through limbs. Easy to sharpen and a great company that makes it. Not enough companies have stepped up to make full tang brush hooks. Every civilization had a version of a sharp hook for harvesting and clearing brush. I hope KA-BAR releases a larger tapered version for more brush cutting.
Sports_and_Outdoors_5,0,"The small size (10L) is a perfect fit for my Kelty Cosmic Down 20 degree sleeping bag. This sack is tough and well built, but a little heavy compared to other options. Mine measures 5.44 oz on a kitchen scale. The zipper pocket hasn't been useful, you can't get anything into or out of it when the sack is compressed. Overall it's a nice piece of gear and should last a long time."
Sports_and_Outdoors_5,0,Great under the desk foot elliptical.  I tend to use it the most when I am on a phone conference meeting.  I can clock 20-30 minutes without even realizing it.  I purchased it because I set at my desk for too many hours and would like additional exercise.  What I like about it is that I can feel my muscles working all the way up in my upper thigh.
Sports_and_Outdoors_5,0,"At a glance upon arrival I was a little worried. The shorts were tiny but it turned out they were a good fit. The material isn't thin and weightless, but its' a solid material that is comfortable. I like how the shorts go down towards the knee. I received a discount on this product through Amazon Review Trader, and the deal made it all especially worth it. Also, the shipment came on time."
Sports_and_Outdoors_5,0,"Purchased two of these for a recent overnight backpacking trip.  Worked really well to compress my ""car"" camping Coleman mummy sleeping back down to a more manageable size and strap to my pack.  Used the second bag to compress the clothes I brought along to save space.  Seem fairly well built and did not fray at all when I pulled the straps tight.  Zippered pocket on the top is useless."
Sports_and_Outdoors_5,0,"...that's not to say they will shoot well in any .22 cal air gun.  Each gun shoots each pellet differently.  There are actually several other pellet brands, shapes & weights that shoot equally as well in the Beeman, but they are considerably more expensive.  So, as cool as the pricier, more 'exotic' pellets are, for me, it's not about cool, it's about accuracy and bang for the buck...and these provide both."
Sports_and_Outdoors_5,0,"The BEST towel I've ever used! It comes with a wash cloth which is huge! It drys you off super quick and air dries in minutes!! BONUS: It comes with a nice flat zipper case with a compartment separately attached to the front to put the wash cloth in for easy travel or storage, if you like. Definitely recommend these towels. Remember ""you always get what you pay for"" These are reasonable priced towels."
Sports_and_Outdoors_5,0,"I now have two of these...one for each of my boys. I have tried numerous other styles and brands and this is the only one the boys have liked and KEPT on.  It definitely isn't for life saving and they have to have some swim technique to keep them upright.  When my son was 2, I would put floaties on him as well and he would bob around the pool all day."
Sports_and_Outdoors_5,0,"Larger than expected, but if you are familiar with HSGI gear then you will love the soft gel padding. All plate carriers will be more comfortable with this upgrade. If you have to use plate carriers for long periods of time, this is a must-have. Very very comfortable and lightweight. Best shoulder pads on the market, much better than the shellback tactical pads. Those are great too but the soft gel makes a difference."
Sports_and_Outdoors_5,0,"we use these to put in our big 20 foot canoe, for the kids to sit comfortably in the middle, but still keep a low center of gravity so we don't tip.  they work marvelously, and their construction is solid--so much better than the similar models we have found at our local outdoor stores (if we find them at all there).  The pivot points and joints where the frame joins are well built."
Sports_and_Outdoors_5,0,"Nice quality and great all around product but frankly. I did not need it and don't use it. Just another accessory that will be lost the time trap that Is my unfinished basement. Sorry bipod, your were created for much better things and I have disrespected you but as your an inanimate object I don't really care. If you need one, this one is great but ""think before you leap"" and save a few bucks"
Sports_and_Outdoors_5,0,"This is a portable charger, not a back up battery. The LED is Red when uncharged and turns Blue when it has a charge. The included retractable cord is extremely thin. Should come in handy during a power failure. It's more of a novelty item than a work horse so it's pricey. Most likely due to licensing fees. Still it's a great gift for the football fan in your life. Available  for many teams."
Sports_and_Outdoors_5,0,"This shirt is a good quality and true to the A's colors.  I am a big guy and it still fits me after quite a few washes.  I don't think this is a fault of the shirt, but for some reason I have gotten weird grease stains on it multiple times.  Thankfully, with a little prewash they come out easily, but I don't know why it happens on this shirt a lot."
Sports_and_Outdoors_5,0,"The description on this erroneously states that it will work for .45 ACP.  It doesn't.  If you try to load .45 ACP with this the cases constantly become hung up when ejecting into the bin.  Instead you need the #45 shell plate.  I'm sure there's nothing wrong with this plate for rifle calibers, but I don't load rifle cartridges on a progressive so its pretty much of no use to me."
Sports_and_Outdoors_5,0,"This is our second set of these bases; the first set lasted for years.  They are very durable!  My boys (ages: 16, 13 & 10) play baseball everyday.  My youngest son always has his friends over and these bases are used over and over.  We just leave them out in the yard.  They lasted for years, before I finally needed to purchase a new set.  Definitely worth the purchase!"
Sports_and_Outdoors_5,0,Awful shoe covers. Difficult to put on and twice as difficult to get off. Not very waterproof and lined with a microfiber fleece that is basically a sponge for any moisture that comes into contact with the sole of your shoes. I got the XXL and it barely fits on a size 8 1/2 shoe without breaking the zipper. If you thinking of thrifty shoe covers go with a plastic bag. You'll be better off.
Sports_and_Outdoors_5,0,"after several hard-cases - too heavy, wheels feel off, etc. , I purchased a new travel cover (club glove like) and the backbone. It is light weight and kept the clubs safe as far as I can tell. The ""latch"" is secure and does not collapse when the release button is pushed - something of a bother when I want it to collapse but better it is hard to collapse than easy."
Sports_and_Outdoors_5,0,"Magnet is very strong for holding the bowl to metal surfaces, pull on parts in the bowl is not nearly as strong. I guess this is good because it makes it easier to pick up small parts, but I would have liked the hold on parts to be slightly stronger. I would also prefer that the inside surface be smooth (no raised logo) so that it would be easier to wipe clean after holding greasy parts."
Sports_and_Outdoors_5,0,"Ordinarily I've used basic Shimano cables when recabling family road bikes, and a more-pro-than-I friend recommended Jagwire.  As other posters have indicated the materials are in the ""non-extreme but solid"" category, and are Jagwire branded though not in retail bubble packaging. Minimal packaging is fine by me.  You could pay a bit less, or you could pay a lot more, but a set of these on hand will get a bike out the door."
Sports_and_Outdoors_5,0,"Bought these for 2 daughters who are into hammock camping and they are the envy of all their friends.  The built in mosquito netting as a super bonus out in the woods.  Only drawback is the straps they come with, they're strong but super simple, no built in loops.  For me, that's fine, but for the girls I went ahead and bought them some pre-looped straps that are easier to use and adjust."
Sports_and_Outdoors_5,0,"As Zebco's go, these are top of the line.  They cast really nice and are easy to use for non-fishermen (which is why I keep buying them for guests to use).  In freshwater they hold up well and continue to cast well, but in saltwater they turn into a pile of rust and the coating on the handle and middle section peels off.  They do seem to still be working despite that though."
Sports_and_Outdoors_5,0,"The plastic is of very low quality. I mounted the mirror, and rode my bike to the store. When I got there, I noticed the mirror had moved out of position. I thought maybe I hadn't tightened it enough, but when I took a closer look, I could see the plastic had cracked all the way through the support arm. I let the 4 1/2 star review trick me ! This is a very low quality product."
Sports_and_Outdoors_5,0,"This is a perfect balance between weight and size.  Penn has always done well for me, so I will stick with them.  It is not as smooth and ""finished"" as some of the higher priced brands out there, but the average person can afford these.  I like the 4.3:1 as well, it can be useful on fast moving fish.  These are fun to use, and they fit and look great on my rods."
Sports_and_Outdoors_5,0,"I had purchased shark tooth mats locally for my home gym and needed more.  I'm glad I found these on Amazon.  These were better than my original mats.  These are gym quality mats.  They are HEAVY because they are heavy duty and protect any flooring.  They are also comfortable on my feet when I am working out.  I highly recommend these over cheaper, lighter weight, and thinner mats some stores sell."
Sports_and_Outdoors_5,0,"Nice bag, thinner than I expected but works out great for the low profile carrier. You can easily fit 2-3 rackets. With 2, you can also fit a can of balls and change of shirt. Side pocket conveniently holds keys, phone, etc. If you want a lot more room for clothes, more balls, etc, get a larger size bag. This one is perfect on the thinner side if that's your preference. Great looking bag and well made."
Sports_and_Outdoors_5,0,"These straps came in today, look and feel great, I had to go over the straps to look for any loose threads to burn away (some hang I always do with new stuff to help prevent anything coming unsewn) and I found a few that could have become an issue way down the road, but all in all these straps look great and really good in comparison to the Nature Hang Outs hammock straps that I have."
Sports_and_Outdoors_5,0,I LIKED IT VERY EASY INSTALL 20 MINUTES START TO FINISH IT REALLY NEDDED MORE BRACING I WILL ADD AND NOT SURE WHY THEY USED UNTREATED PINE ON RUNNERS I WILL HAVE TO CHANGE THEM OUT BUT AMAZON IS GREAT TO DEAL WITH BUT IT IS REALLY ONLY MADE FOR USE WITH JON BOATS SOMETHING VERY LIGHT WHEN YOU BUMP THEM TO GUIDE YOUSELF ON THE TRAILER THEY WILL MOVE AROUND SOME AND HAVE TO BE AJUSTED
Sports_and_Outdoors_5,0,"...I find that it gets weird stains easily.  I only use this on one of my clients.  The rest of the time, I have it in my closet.  If it rests against something that has print on it (think a box with color), it seems to absorb some of the color and turns this weird yellowish-greyish stain on the ball's surface.  Other than that, this ball works great and is great for travel."
Sports_and_Outdoors_5,0,The first one worked so well that we decided to pick up another one.  I love the auto-off feature that keeps me from draining batteries.  I can shoot a rifle with these on although they still have a tendency to get in the way.  Great for indoor ranges because I can double up with plugs and these and still hear the person next to me without the extra noise that usually accompanies indoor ranges.
Sports_and_Outdoors_5,0,"It is a good addition to my hiking pack. Easy to use and reasonable light to carry. Only issue is when you lube the chain. It stinks up the backpack and soaks into the carrying bag, so I couldn't add it as is to my hiking/hunting backpack, since the criters can smile me a mile away. I did double bag the carrying case with zip loc bags, but it is the only reason it didn't get 5 stars."
Sports_and_Outdoors_5,0,"For a Schwinn Product these mirrors are real ""Clunky"". They only come in LEFT side fittings. They don't stay in adjustment on ""Ball-socket"" & they swivel around on it. You also need to purchase lock washers to keep the stems from rotating around. I have had other mirrors work better for less money. I can't believe  Schwinn put their name on it. (The Ball Socket Should have set screws in them to keep the mirror in adjustment)."
Sports_and_Outdoors_5,0,These little lights are the coolest! Our boys (10 and 7) just love them:) They were super easy to install and even came with a zip tie to make sure they don't fall off. We just ordered some more because they love hem so much. To get a full circle of light when moving we will need to put one more light onto each tire (a total of 2 on each tire). They shine pretty bright at night.

Movies_and_TV_5,0,It's one of those dvds where you don't feel too bad about plopping your kids in front of the tv. Educational and engrossing for the youngsters.
Movies_and_TV_5,0,"The kiddo loves this, we love this. It has turned into a tradition- we read the book and watch the movie. Wholesome, moral, entertaining, great animation."
Movies_and_TV_5,0,"Hilarious and even if you do not like the movie you get to look at Channing Tatum throughout the it, so it's a win win :)"
Movies_and_TV_5,0,We found a cut place on one of the dvd watching it . It totally stop working. A one star rating they don't deserve even that.
Movies_and_TV_5,0,"I've used this movie for many years for my summer day camps, and for introducing ""eventing"" to young people.  Enjoyable movie for kids and adults."
Movies_and_TV_5,0,avatar has nothing on this movie this is the best movie in american history. the era it was made in considering that everthing looks very real.
Movies_and_TV_5,0,"My husband liked it, but I was bored. It didn't really hold my interest. I also felt like the ending could have been wrapped up better."
Movies_and_TV_5,0,"Toney Randall played second in a number of funny films but he made a few as the lead and this is one of the funniest, thx."
Movies_and_TV_5,0,Great show...just like all the other seasons.  Have to wonder how much longevity this show will have since they only shoot 3 episodes per season.
Movies_and_TV_5,0,fantistic dirty comedy with no nudity i am going to watch it over and over it might be bearly clesn enough to let the kids watch.
Movies_and_TV_5,0,"I am glad I watched it - it was good, clean fun.  Shows that movies CAN be made without bad language and still be good!"
Movies_and_TV_5,0,"If you enjoy the Big Bang, then this is a must buy.  Good buy if you want to catch up on any missed several episodes."
Movies_and_TV_5,0,"Disappointed in the deviation from the book.  Hey I get it.. you have all of these successful characters from ""LOTR""  still a cool movie."
Movies_and_TV_5,0,Star trek is one of movies that I like to see. I enjoy Sci-fi movies more then other kind of movies. I will watch others anyway.
Movies_and_TV_5,0,"Great movie, had wanted to see it for such a long time, thought I might be disappointed but it was refreshingly different and entertaining with twists."
Movies_and_TV_5,0,"Im sorry iddi not see it in the theater but it was well worth the wait to see it on dvd, and one of cages best"
Movies_and_TV_5,0,"I like the message in the movie. People are not always your friend for the right reason. In fact, friends don't even have to be people!"
Movies_and_TV_5,0,I THOROUGHLY ENJOY WATCHING IT.  I WAITED QUITE A WHILE TO GET THE DVD AND AM ANXIOUSLY WAITING UNTIL THE GOOD WITCHES GARDEN IS RELEASED.
Movies_and_TV_5,0,"Excellent transfer.  The 3D is seamless and not overdone.  There were a few ""wow"" moments.  The surround sound was also subtle but effective."

Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5,1,Works well through 4 charge time. The only issue is that it takes a little getting used to.
Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5,1,This item was exactly as described. The only problem is that it comes with a small screw driver.
Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5,1,easy to use but not a real pain.  I've also used this for a few hours.
Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5,1,Perfect quality and length for what it is.  Not too large or too small for my desk.

Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5,1,finally I found a replacement for my old one.  I will update this review if I find
Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5,1,It's ok for what i needed it for.  I've had it for a couple of years
Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5,1,All of these Chums were perfect for the job.  I will keep them in the tool box
Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5,1,"Nice for those who need a little more space to hold a saw blade, just the right angle."
Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5,0,Appear to be of good quality.  They are going to be exposed to winter weather so we will see how well they hold up after winter in the northeast.  For now Ill givr it 5 stars but will update if they don't hold up.
Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5,0,"These are cheap. I'm not talking price wise, I mean cheaply made. The silver has started to flake off and I've bent one of the brass punches already. I'm not happy with them. At least they were Price cheap too. You get what you pay for."
Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5,0,"This a decent bag. It's the right size for the tools I have. The shoulder strap was what made this the winner over similar bags. The only thing I don't like is that it does not have internal pockets. Otherwise, I am satisfied with this purchase!"
Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5,0,These are the real deal!  Ive ordered the cheaper ones and even though they say they come with screws they dont. These do and they are much more sturdy. I will buy these from now on and save a trip to the hardware store for screws
Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5,0,They're hex wrenches.  Good length for torque. Ball end for those bolts that you need to get a little angle on.  Lots of sizes.  I got these and the matching metric set and tossed all the odd one-off's I had in my tool bag.
Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5,0,1 1/2 years equals one star. I'm starting to wonder if anything is built to last anymore. Another cracked seat as others have posted. I suppose left handed folks will have their crack on the opposite side. The bold look of Kohler. Are you listening yet Kohler!
Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5,0,Works.  I wish I could have left my braided line in place.. it had a safety shutoff.. just in case the line broke or something and I was not around.  This one.. you have to be there to shut it off.  But it works.
Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5,0,It is a pretty simple device. For me the nice feature was the built in igniter. It is very reliable and easy to operate.  It keeps your hands away from the flame when you light it. Very handy for those that don't use torches a lot.
Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5,0,"This little thing is so much better than any multitool pliers I've ever used.  I stopped carrying a multitool because they are usually just a collection of inferior tools.  These small pliers pack a punch.  Built tough, and I use them all the time."
Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5,0,"I can't count of the number of times I've been able to squeeze into a tight spot with this ratchet.  It has a nice sturdy construction and the thick ""grippy"" handle lets you spin it even when the handle is at nearly a 90 degree angle."
Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5,0,"For the money its an excellent value. Its for light duty home use. As long as your not trying to grind 1 inch rebar to a point , you should be OK. I use it for sharpening drill bits and chisels."
Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5,0,I bought two of these for our home and love them.  They work extremely well with our Home Security system which allows us to control them through the same APP.  It makes it nice to have a smart home and control the temperature from anywhere.
Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5,0,I bought these with the intention of using them in my Dremel tool (not actually a Dremel but a craftsman type Dremel). But they won't work in it because the shaft is too small and the collet won't tighten up enough to secure the shaft to it.
Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5,0,"Waste of money.  The batteries only last for max 20 hours (if at all).  What is the point?  Batteries are almost more expensive than the string lights.  I have never ever given a 1-star rating, there is always a first... and appropriately so."
Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5,0,"Lights arrived promptly and were exactly what I wanted.  The quality appears to be top notch with a heavy duty materials used.  Lights are nice a bright, but not too bright to drive your neighbors crazy.  So far so good.  Time will tell."
Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5,0,"This thing is great. Got it to capture my young daughter's attention and hopefully get her interested in science early. It's really lightweight and feels cheap in hand, but for the price you can't do better. Oh and my daughter loves playing with this thing."
Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5,0,"This cartridge is a piece of junk. The plastic stop on the stem keeps breaking. Other people have the same problem. (eg read the reviews on the Home Depot webpage.)  You can't even get the plastic stop itself, you have to buy the whole cartridge. Ridiculous."
Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5,0,This is just what I need for my application. I would have given it 5 stars but it is not stainless steel. It is galvanized steel. Seller should give the right description in the right up. This is misrepresenting the product. I was expecting stainless not galvanized steel.
Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5,0,"Got them yesterday, Hung them this morning and set them for motion detection and when the sun went down they worked perfectly. Nice dim light on all the time and bright light when motion is detected.  Simple install and great product. If they last I'll be thrilled!"
Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5,0,Sometimes a little difficult to get the right bite.  A little uncomfortable after a couple uses.  But you rarely have to use one of these.  And a lot of fittings come with this already.  So now I have a small jar full of them.
Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5,0,"Ugh... Check the hole of your door first.  Turned into a project, otherwise simple install (after you get done customizing a jig to cut bigger hole into door).  Pretty cool not to have to use a key though.  A little bulky though, especially on inside."
Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5,0,Color rendering of this lamp is sub par. The color temperature seems cooler than the indicated 3000K as well. Overall a harsh light that does not work well in a residential setting. Consider it for a utility space perhaps? Quickly returned and replaced by a superior Philips lamp.
Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5,0,"Installation was easy. The faucet looks great. The only issue I have is that even on stream, these is still a small amount of spray around the main stream. For instance, when I pull it out and fill my coffee maker, there is spray around the fill hole..."
Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5,0,"Powerful and tiny and portable and a great price.  Please be sure, however, that you attach the sanding pad to the bottom...for some reason the hook-and-loop pad on the bottom of this device doesn't stand up so well when there's no sanding paper attached.  Go figure.."
Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5,0,I was a little skeptical when I first purchased this. I bought it to enhance an indoor area by our front door. It gives a wonderful light and is very fun to look at. I only use it during the summer and will buy another one next year.
Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5,0,"I was very satisfied with these lights having instant brightness when they came on, but then without any warning they just went out and would not come back on. They were only on my garage for 1 year. I will not take another chance buying this brand again."
Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5,0,"Dim light on after unlock and activated the solar light. the light gets brighter when detected motion. Size of the light is 3 inches by 4 inches included 2 screw, can mount with one screw at  the center top of light. Price is comparable to similar products."
Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5,0,I'm very happy with this light! I used it to replace out old and outdated porch light. It was very easy to install and it works great! We set it up with a smart bulb so we can use Alexa to turn it off and on.
Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5,0,"Consistent tool performance until the battery is dead versus continual slowdown with NiCD batteries.  Most notable in high power usage devices like a circular saw.  So far, I feel it is worth the extra cost.  However, I did need to purchase another charger for LiION."
Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5,0,"This cap is awesome!  I saw it on the show, Dr. Oakley, Yukon Vet and thought it looked like it would work for me while hunting.  Saves me from having to put a headlamp on.  Lights are bright.  Hat is comfortable.  Would highly recommend."
Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5,0,"It doesn't look as refined as the 1/4 version but it does the job. It comes with a blown mold carrying case. The ratcheting mechanism looks a bit too harsh, it feels like you have to give at least a quarter of a turn to get a click (ratchet)."
Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5,0,"This is a great product that provides precision drilling for a good price. The vise (Proxxon 28132) is a must. The unit is compact. Even after reading other reviews about the size, when the box arrived it was smaller than anticipated. That said, it has more than exceeded expectations."
Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5,0,We have one of these in our child's room - it's a nice level for providing navigation and anti-monster light without being too bright.  They're light weight and durable so the other is in our travel kit and gets used in hotel rooms when we're on the road.
Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5,0,"I bought this light several months  ago, it has been in use on a dusk to dawn sensor since then, it has worked exactly as advertised so far. The light color is quite white, at least 5000K but as an outdoor l flood light it has been excellent."
Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5,0,"I do like that you can point the draft in all directions. however, it's insanely flimsy. also the frame is smaller than the register I had there before. there is a small gap that is not being covered at the edge. my old register covered the gaps just fine."
Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5,0,"Smart design. Like the fact that the keyring is integral to tool. Issue I normally have with key chain tools is separating the tool from the key, a problem than this tool solves rather well. That said, I have barely used it, and much prefer  the leather-man squirt."
Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5,0,I order these for a shower as they came up in my search.  Unfortunately they were far too short to be able to use.  The metal was durable and the finish was perfect.  We returned the item since it wasn't going to work for our needs
Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5,0,"great fan and works well in my small bathroom...... so quiet... like a previous post.. my wall was about 6.5 Inches thick, does require cutting with snips the metal that allows the junction box to fit in.. not a deal breaker, but does take a little work to fix..."
Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5,0,"Well, they work! They do extend the bulb by about and inch but that was expected. I recommend using low wattage energy efficient bulbs because anytime you add an adapter to something like this there is a chance of overheating. I have not had that problem with these though."
Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5,0,"Needed a new wrench as someone had made off with my old one. Does what I need it to do, which is open bungs. I usually use it to open bungs on 55-gallon steel drums, but I have been known to open a bung or two on plastic drums."
Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5,0,Purchased this spout to match other delta hardware with the same finish.  Matches perfectly and looks great.  Haven't installed it yet so hope it performs as well as it looks.  Packaged great and shipped quickly.  Received the item in two days.  Another great Amazon purchase!
Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5,0,"This is an ok tool to have. When I first received it the safety pin on the handle spinner came off and got lost in the mail, I replaced the pin with a new one and made some adjustments to spinner to keep it in place, now it work ok."
Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5,0,"The tp-link classic remote switch that works with Alexa. They work fine once configured. Only thing I don't like is to configure them, you have to run their app on iOS or Android.  None exists for Windows so if you don't have one of these smart phones, stay away"
Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5,0,These are excellent filters and do a great job. Water tastes very good after going thru these filters then filtered further in a filtering water pitcher. Which I highly recommend. These filters are great when filtering for general water usage is done. But I recommend further filtering for drinking water.
Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5,0,It is a good option for a beginner who does not mind spending the extra money.  It is over priced for the purpose it serves if you have good wood working skills.  It is a well made product 4 for quality but a 2.5 star for the price
Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5,0,"Disappointed.  It would not split some logs I could split with a maul.  The motor takes a couple seconds to spool up for each stroke, which is annoying.  The design requiring both hands to engage probably keeps some lawyer happy somewhere but is very clumsy to operate."
Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5,0,"Great fit. I recommend spending a bit more to buy these high quality gloves, instead of burning through pair after pair of the cheaper gloves. I found that I kept wearing holes in the fingertips of the other gardening gloves, resulting in fingernails full of dirt. These have reinforced fingertips."
Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5,0,We went with a different set up but we are keeping these as we could use this in our kids play house. It's longer then we hoped for and a difficult application but if you need a universal bracket for the ceiling or end of window mounting this will work.
Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5,0,"Has about every security screw, driver bit you might need. Flimsy box, and the rack does not hold the bits very tight. The longer bits are great for getting into tight spaces. You may not use these often, but these bits are hard to find at a big box store."
Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5,0,"Buyer beware. The product description talks about the Kevlar content of Ansell gloves. They must be talking about the medium and heavy duty gloves, not these light duty gloves. They contain no Kevlar. Not saying they are bad gloves, and they will work as intended...light duty. Also an excellent price."
Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5,0,"I bought two vests for my wife and I for walking the dog at night - a yellow one for me and this pink one for her.  She loves it, it helps considerably with cars seeing her and it has pockets in the front (my yellow one does not!)"
Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5,0,"I've yet to turn to this kit and not find the bit I need to complete a project. It's got what I need and I love that. I also love knowing that if something did go wrong with a piece, Tekton will stand behind their tools from what I've seen."
Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5,0,"Warm white does not mean clear. I was hoping this string would match the clear LED lights on the rest of my house, but while they are not as ""blueish"" as the soft white LED's they still have a tiny blue hue to them. Aside from that they were fine."
Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5,0,"Excellent. Could be to much suction for different components, but this issue is very easy to fix. I use plumbing tee fittings to control amount of suction. Quiet operation, professional look, excellent performance. I use this pump for my manual pick and place machine and highly recommend it to others."
Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5,0,I am never without a bottle of Weldbond close at hand in my work shop. I use it to bond everything and I especially like it's flexibility and stability in hot weather. All in a glue that's non-toxic and water cleanup without any fumes or even that urea smell from Elmers.
Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5,0,A great accessory for any 3/8 ratchet system. Allows for greater reach in hard to reach places. Or allows a bit of distance to get a better leverage in tight areas. Great price. Plan on getting a 1/4 drive extension kit soon. A great buy/gift for your mechanics or DIY persons.
Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5,0,The adjuster works ok but sometimes it's difficult to get it to lock down properly. When it locks properly this is a really easy to use wrench and it's a good physical size making it pretty easy to get into most tight spots (as much as expected with a large wrench).
Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5,0,"Wasn't too impressed with this, it was broken and I needed to return it. I did not reorder because o just wasn't impressed with the material or it. I figured if it was broken so easily when it supposed to be sturdy and strong there was no sense and re-ordering it."
Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5,0,Was too heavy for the cheap set I bought (and returned) and currently are not using it; afraid it will put stress on the lines inside the wall and will end up with a mess I don't know about till it's too late but does work as expected; kind of expensive
Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5,0,This item does not look like it will take much abuse but it's for an emergency. I took it out of the packing it came in and vacuum packed it and it compressed down real flat.. I would have given 5 stars if I thought it would last a little longer.
Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5,0,Use it to heat the portion of my Thunderjet boat under canvas. Heated the cabin very well in 20 degree temps!  Grill that protects the unit get very hot!  Purchased the 1 gallon steel cylinder and 10 foot hose along with it to extend usage.
Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5,0,"Great product, we live out in the country and have no city lights. For our dog that we allow to run off leash this works great. We can see him as would our neighbors be able to if he got into the road. The battery life is good but not awesome."
Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5,0,I bought this pump to replace my old wayne and this one is far superior. Its super fast and very quiet. I put in a new quiet check valve and I can't even here this run unless I'm right beside it. I would highly recommend. (Update) Two years later switch failed
Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5,0,"I gave this product 3 stars only because I feel that it is very well made however, for me it was not a good choice because it is just too bulky to carry around. It will protect the flashlight and if you don't mind the size, it is worth the money."
Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5,0,"I have washed them out and reused them. How nice. I'm doing a lot of wood and wall sanding, they go from one to the other great but occasionally I hit paint and these cleaned up nicely with warm soap and water just make sure you give them time to dry"
Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5,0,Excellent stone to compliment my library of stones.  I have several for getting the knives to a decent edge and this one to really work the final polish on my blades.  The rubber base is really grippy and holds the stone to the counter when I am using it.
Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5,0,"I love these things, I hope they never go cheap on these like so many other items do. Always a clean cut, available in many sizes, clean up well and hang in there.  You want a  machine grade cut in aluminum, steel, plastic, .....wood... start here..... with the Champion cutters."
Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5,0,"This painter's tape has a strong stick. This is good once you have it on the wall, but it makes it challenging to unroll it. If I was not pulling really evenly as I unrolled the tape, it split off and tore. It did not leave any residue when I removed it."
Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5,0,This is a really good ladder.  My only criticism on the installation instructions is that they should have a picture that illustrates where the retaining bolts/nails go instead of a written description.  A picture is worth 1000 words (and they only used about 20 to try describe the nail placement).
Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5,0,I used this shortly after receiving it and will use it a LOT more for my work.  I drill thru HM doors and this ensures the thru hole on the other side is lined up properly with the initial hole.  No more correcting a slightly off hole with this guide.
Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5,0,"I bought two, one malfunctioned within a week. The alarm goes off several times a day. I placed two in the same room, this one goes off, the other other doesn't. Placed both next to an opened window, same thing: this one goes off for no reason and claims there is fire."
Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5,0,I broke my filter/silencer off my Craftsman 1.5 gallon air compressor several years back and forgot about it.  I pulled it out a while back and realized this piece was missing so I ordered this one to replace it.  Quieted the compressor right down...I should have got it years ago.
Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5,0,"A ""must have"" for anyone who uses Milwaukee cordless drills professionally. Instead of hunting around on a job site for two or three unused electrical outlets for two or three chargers, one can keep all one's batteries charging in one location. Excellent quality and less expensive than buying from our local retailer."
Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5,0,"Purchased this saw blade for a miter saw that takes an uncommon 8 1/4"" saw blade. I used it to cut pine and red oak trim as well as to square up red oak plywood. Cuts are very clean with no splintering or tear out. Blade is still sharp after numerous cuts."
Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5,0,Works great.  More powerful than the old pump that it replaces.  I use this to pump water off the pool cover in the winter.  I do wish it has an auto-off when the water drop below a certain level.  That's not available for this model.  Oh well.
Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5,0,These work amazing under my recliner.  I placed 2 at the front and 2 at the back under the recliner and so far so good.  I haven't had to reposition the recliner because it is hitting the wall.  My recliner sits on carpet.  Problem solved!  Happy customer!
Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5,0,"I use to have a Big Blue filter, and struggled changing filters every few months.  Then I had one crack on me. Fortunally I was home.  I bought this to replace it.  I love the ease of changing filters and the peace of mind that it is a metal housing."
Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5,0,I really like this design.  Much easier that the older style where you had to reach down and move the device to hold the door open.  To close all you do is push the door open just a bit more and the door closes automatically. Nice when you are carrying something.
Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5,0,"I absolutely love this device, I have replaced most receptacles with these around the house. giving us 15am usb ports which quickly charge devices such as smart phones, tables, portable gaming consoles and Bluetooth speakers. get this now, all you need is basic understanding and safety to install this. you will love it."
Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5,0,"Excellent pocket knife and just what I was looking for.  Sharp out of the box and is easy to open once you get the feel for it.  A little on the heavy side but it's really nice for the money.  I don't think you could go wrong, all things considered."
Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5,0,"Seems to be good quality, easy to install, fitted perfectly in my 6 inch kitchen duct. Hopefully this will prevent the horrible smells that come from Indian food cooking in condo downstairs. My guess is that it would need to be replaced at some point because of all the grease entering kitchen hood"
Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5,0,Yes! Saves my ears from wood shop noise as well as yard work machinery. I got a second one for my wife to use for her daily smoothie- the decibel level of that Blendtec is literally painful to my ears and can't be healthy to be regularly exposed to. She actually uses it!
Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5,0,Great directional night light.  My 4 year old and 2 year old will not sleep unless these are on.  Its good product to keep around the house for those times you wake up to use the restroom.  Good solid product that hasn't failed after a solid 2 years of use.
Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5,0,There is a reason it is so inexpensive. It emits a loud buzz when a USB device is plugged into it. And it is so wide that it would be dangerous to install in a metal box or in any box with another device. Spend a few more bucks on a better product.
Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5,0,"Good scriber. A little pricey, but you don't have much choice when it comes to these. It holds up well (if you don't lose the first one like I did), and the tip seems to be very hard and hold it's point. Would buy again (hopefully I won't have to."
Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5,0,"That is as long as Gerber Makes them. I don't remember how many I've had over the years, since Gerber started making them around 1980, and how many I've lost or mislaid. This is one I won't be without. I give them as gifts at Christmas and have never had one returned, hahaha!"
Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5,0,"For the price this caulk gun is pretty fantastic. easy to use and doesn't make you curse or swear. There can be a little dripping of caulk, but that happens with every caulk gun I've ever used. Smooth and easy to use, would buy the same one over again if I needed to."
Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5,0,"Good price point and some nice color options.  Use to change the colors on the front of the house as the seasons change.  Green for St. Patrick's Day, Red for Valentines Day etc.  And being LED not so bad on the electric bill.  First one lasted me a few years."
Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5,0,"Looks great and fits well into old standard sink basin. The top does look much larger than the usual bathroom sink drain, so if you don't like that large size, look elsewhere.  My sink wasn't the most cosmetically appealing anyway, so the large drain improves the look considerably. Attached are the before/after pics."
Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5,0,"a bit technical to set up and I am a techy person, but they do the job and work great for the room heaters I have around the house. Saving money since we were running them too long when we weren't home or in the rooms. Now I don't have to worry about them."
Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5,0,"Made like garbage. These Cree bulbs are made of glass covered with a thin layer of soft plastic. While bright enough, they will break - shattering the inner glass - at the slightest provocation. I ordered several of these bulbs and half arrived broken or with defects in the plastic layer covering the glass."
Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5,0,"Great gloves. I'm large in Black Diamond gloves, but the mechanix are a bit larger, so I guess I must be medium. Great finger and hand rubber protection. I use these for wood work, bike ridding, weight lifting and chin ups. Only down side is that they don't come with kevlar protection. Good buy."
Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5,0,Never thought I would own one of these. Works fantastic and is easy to install. Needed it for a door that leads to my outdoor deck. My Newfie can  go in and out without a problem. One year old and is still in fantastic shape considering I do not have a covered deck.
Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5,0,This is a well built and designed mailbox.  People will not be able to reach into the box to steal your mail like other similar looking boxes.  The mounting plate makes it easy to secure the mailbox to it's base without having to hold the whole box in place.  Highly recommended.
Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5,0,"Perfect bulb for recessed lighting. I replaced my CFL bulbs and recommend these to everyone looking to upgrade to LED. The light output is superior to the CFL bulbs. It's amazing how these bulbs can transition a room from dingy yellow to warm white. Give them a try, you will really like the difference."
Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5,0,Great little keychain addition. Has your typical screw drivers and bottle opener. But I never thought I would use the pry bar feature as much as I do. I used the pry bar function so many times I almost replace my crow bar. Ok maybe not but it does and will come in handy.
Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5,0,I am using R438A (R22 drop in replcement) and R134A for my car A/C and my old (relatively speaking) leak detector would not respond to either of these refrigerants. The MyPin Pro however works on older refrigerants and these new blends with very good sensetivity at a modest price.  Highly recommend this product.
Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5,0,"Very modern looking and works well for small bathroom.  The sound of the fan is not bad.  Sure you can hear it is running, but it is not obnoxious noise.  I was painting the ceiling on a very cold windy day and there was no cold air blowing back into the bathroom."
Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5,0,I use this on my fish aquarium and it is the best i could find. dual outlets are nice. wish you could control each separately. i picked this because it is digital and has a built in RECHARGEABLE battery. It'll stay program despite power outages. Never thought I could like a wall outlet so much.
Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5,0,"Very easy to apply and dries quickly enough for second application. Don't know why people complain about this dripping, just have a paper towel in your free hand while you brush on the sealent. Very simple and there is plenty of solution for multiple jobs. You only need one bottle for a standard bathroom space."
Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5,0,Before you purchase & then leave a bad review  always read the product description. As stated this is a 10 hour charger that does not include a charging cord. This charger works great with my lithium & standard Stinger batteries. Unlike standard batteries lithium batteries will blink when fully recharged when using this device.

Pet_Supplies_5,0,"Nice collars for the money.  I like the adjustability, so my kittens can grow into them.  The cats lose them once in a while, but I have a Loc8tor tag on each collar, so they're easy to find."
Pet_Supplies_5,0,This worked great in the wire cage I had just purchased for my dog. It stayed straight and no water spilled from the bowl. It kept the bowl from being dumped in the cage which would have made a real mess.
Pet_Supplies_5,0,My dog loves this ball and he cannot chew it and eat the ball.  It makes a little sound once in a while.  He even wants to take it to bed at night but I draw the line there.
Pet_Supplies_5,0,"We have two of these. The large would be too big for our dogs. Our dogs range from 14-26 lbs. Good toy, easy for humans to see, less of a trip hazard for bipeds. Nonadjustable, but large kibble would work fine."
Pet_Supplies_5,0,"Nice bowls for the price,  they are small but hold just the right amount of food for my cats. Made well,  sturdy for the money. Pleased. You also get two bowls for the price, I believe, for just one."
Pet_Supplies_5,0,I have been using this Pro home pet grooming kit for a while now. My old one broke so I purchased a new one. I would highly recommend this product to anyone who wants to do home grooming of their animals.
Pet_Supplies_5,0,This bear (and the bunny too) are the only toys that my 5 month old puppy (with razor sharp teeth) hasn't torn to shreds. They've lasted for months with no loose threads or rips. I will be buying the piggy next!
Pet_Supplies_5,0,"Our kitties always eat it all. Tells us that it's good, I always read the ingredient list of my cats' food, I want them to have the best I can give them. Merrick provides a nice variety of foods they love."
Pet_Supplies_5,0,"Doggy toys, just make sure you remove the electronic part with the battery before they swallow it. That is if your dog is a chew monster like mine. This is a good rule for all dog toys with batteries or electronics."
Pet_Supplies_5,0,Very sturdy I have a 7 lb dog and he goes up and down no problem also I have a wood floor and it doesn't move around whenhe goes up and down. Easy to put together also don't need any tools.
Pet_Supplies_5,0,Very handy but the only thing that's annoying is that you have to make the dog step into the arm holes or put the dog's feet into the holes.  Would be better if it attached at the belly as well
Pet_Supplies_5,0,"Had this in the back of a Nuvo Fusion 20 and it worked well. I've moved it over to a 65 gallon where it's now solely running Phosguard and I'm still very happy with it. It's a great, small media reactor."
Pet_Supplies_5,0,"Great food, one of my favorites for my goldfish and other omnivorous fish. Works great on a clip, or just soak and dump in the tank. I have also found it works great in gel food for added nutrition and fiber."
Pet_Supplies_5,0,"I love being able to choose a door to open to let dogs in and out. It was easy to put together, great price, low maintenance, good quality, and my two small dogs love it when I have to leave home."
Pet_Supplies_5,0,My dog's ears were just a horrible mess and smelled like rotten____ been using this product for about a week and his ears have changed tremendously for the better will let you know in two more weeks how things are going
Pet_Supplies_5,0,Best carpet cleaner out there! We have two dogs and in our spot and big steam cleaner it takes care of anything that comes out of them. Love the smell too! Its lighly minty and didn't linger for days like others.
Pet_Supplies_5,0,I ordered an XS for my 15  pound Maltipoo with a 20 inch girth.  Fit perfectly and is lightweight for the Florida heat.  No questions are ever asked by vendors about the authenticity of  my service dog.
Pet_Supplies_5,0,"I like the look of this leash and it's comfortable in my hand when I'm walking my dog, but the hook hardware is big and heavy for a small dog so I would not recommend this for dogs less than 20lbs."
Pet_Supplies_5,0,"Tried this shampoo several times on my dog hoping it would work after some time and it didn't help with anything. Didn't work for itching or hot spots, not even for a day. Unfortunately, it doesn't live up to its claim."
Pet_Supplies_5,0,"My Yorkie loves his wee wee tray and, thank heavens, knows how to use it!  The top clips onto the base and secures the pad which prevents liquid from leaking off the edge.  This is a must have item."
Pet_Supplies_5,0,"I received the product today. My puppy has not played with it for more than 10 seconds, but I don't really think it's the bone's fault so I'm still giving it 4 stars. My dog can be picky with his toys."
Pet_Supplies_5,0,"My 3 months old kitty really love this toy but it broke the next day. The ""joint"" of the suspender is too weak to withstand the pull. I just cut off the string and let my kitty have the mouse instead."
Pet_Supplies_5,0,"I have to rotate cat food now that my cats are more than 15 years old.  They like to change every 7 - 10 days, so I keep three different kinds on hand.  This is one of their favorites."
Pet_Supplies_5,0,"I love this!  The only part of owning a cat that I HATED, is now just a mere chore.  If this ever brakes or needs replacement for some other unforeseen reason, I will be re-ordering as quickly as possible!"
Pet_Supplies_5,0,"I bought this to trick out yorkie and yorkie-poo into better smiles.  While the spray smells nice and minty - the size of the ball is too big for my 5 and 12 pound dogs.  So for me, it's okay."
Pet_Supplies_5,0,fits well and is cool enough for weather up to about 80 then its a little heavy and I have to switch to the net type fly sheet. I was hoping to use it all summer for preventing coat bleaching. nice construction.
Pet_Supplies_5,0,Required for MN 4-H for advanced obedience class.  My lab hated it.  He doesn't pick up.  I want to try to float it in the lake and have him get used to it that way.  It as fine.
Pet_Supplies_5,0,I assumed purchasing this light that for the price it would burn out immediately.  Not only has that not happened but I have owned it for over a year now and it is as good as new.  Buy with confidence.
Pet_Supplies_5,0,"Really great dog food; I was excited to have my dogs try this! Grain-Free Dry Dog & contains no corn, by-product meals or artificial ingredients. It has good meat & veggies in it which is healthy. MY dogs seem to love it!"
Pet_Supplies_5,0,"My two ""boys"" are crazy for these and bat them up and down a 50 ft. hallway for extended periods. Most balls lose their interest quickly! There's something in the design that attracts them so much that they even share a ball:-)"
Pet_Supplies_5,0,"Both cats go crazy-happy when I groom them with this brush, and it removes A LOT of loose hairs with each brushing. It really is easy to clean, too, and I haven't had to deal with a hairball in months."
Pet_Supplies_5,0,"This is a great interactive food puzzle and works wonders on our high-energy year old pup! Keeps him occupied while we visit with houseguests and instead of jumping up and carrying on, he's learning that guests mean the treat ball comes out"
Pet_Supplies_5,0,"Great leash, the length is great, and it has a firm hold with my dog. Just be cautious, they don't recommend using retractable leashes with choke chains and harness to stop dogs from pulling as there is constant tension on the leash."
Pet_Supplies_5,0,"The only problem I have is that the two little shelf covers are a b**** to get on, it's reculously hard, but the two big ones slide right on and they are really soft. I wish they came in other colors though"
Pet_Supplies_5,0,"Good for labs, beagles...all furr kiddos with droopy ears. 7f you don't have this in your veterinary supply kit, you should.  We got a new pup who kept scatching his ears, this sure soothed him until we got him cleated up."
Pet_Supplies_5,0,This is the best treat bag ever!!!  It's easy to open and close while having both hands free.  Would definitely purchase again.  I've tried three other bags and this is the only one that is now in our home
Pet_Supplies_5,0,I really like this but was a little large.  The quality is there for sure though and would recommend to anyone needing a large collar for a very large dog.  This was too large for my 100 lb. lab mix.
Pet_Supplies_5,0,"My cats seemed to like this at first, but now I haven't seen them on it since. They don't use it as a scratcher either, they just use it as a lounge. The product itself is fine, my kitties are just picky."
Pet_Supplies_5,0,"This is easy to put together and nice looking, for a cat drinking fountain.  But the motor is noisy--could hear it over the TV in the next room--and our cats were not interested in it at all.  Sent it back."
Pet_Supplies_5,0,"I didn't realize the pieces would be so chunky. I guess the product is fine for reptiles, and just not for crabs. I used it towards the bottom of my tank and mixed it with sand. It does hold moisture very well."
Pet_Supplies_5,0,"It works very well for smoothing my cat's coat. It does not remove tough knots but I have a very fine tooth comb for that. This is a finishing brush. I like that the metal bristles retract, making it easy to clean."
Pet_Supplies_5,0,"I have 2 boxers that I felt needed a little warming at night, even though they sleep in the house.  The fit is true to size and the length is appropriately long.  Washes well and my dogs don't mind them."
Pet_Supplies_5,0,"The pieces were so small my min-pin swallowed them whole...That is why I gave them  a 3. I gave them to a friend who has a tea cup poodle, and she really likes them so they also need a 5 from her.."
Pet_Supplies_5,0,"This works a little better than most clumping litters, but it still tracks and doesn't do as good a job as Cedarific to fight odor. It is very expensive to pay $18 to barely fill two litter boxes; won't purchase in the future."
Pet_Supplies_5,0,"Packed Well by Amazon and arrived undamaged.  However, all 6 of my cats didn't like it.  They picked at it and left if for the dogs to clean up!  First Friskies Flavor I've found that NONE of my cats liked!"
Pet_Supplies_5,0,they are already gone - have 2 lop-eared bunnies who love this product.  Kaytee is a good brand to begin with and these cubes are no exception.  They are not too difficult to separate.  My bunnies approve of this product!
Pet_Supplies_5,0,"Our rat terrier loves chicken and she eats the grilled chicken every evening.  I'm picky about her food because she's diabetic, but she's eaten this food for several years and seems to be doing fine on it.  It's conveniently packaged, too."
Pet_Supplies_5,0,"Quality collars, very impressed with the craftsmanship. Only 4 stars because the posted measurements are incorrect. They should have fit both of my dogs; one 50lbs but stocky, the other 70lbs. They could both slip out of these. I returned and ordered Medium."
Pet_Supplies_5,0,"...but look at each others dish first to see what the other guy got! LOL. Why the red dye, 9Lives? AND I haven't had to use a can opener to open a can in a long time. I will not buy this again."
Pet_Supplies_5,0,"My dogs love these treats, but I can't understand the HUGE price increase over the last few months.  I used to buy these on Prime for $21.99 for 6 boxes.  I can understand a small increase, but nearly $12?  Why?"
Pet_Supplies_5,0,The carabiner is kind of a pain to use.  I like it because it fits well in a pocket when I am not using it.  To be honest it is not much better than a cheap leash that costs 5 bucks.
Pet_Supplies_5,0,"My mini dachshunds managed to rip the head open within half an hour, along with chew the ears off and start on the legs. Thankfully it was cheap, so I'm not annoyed. It does say on the packet it isn't for strong chewers."
Pet_Supplies_5,0,"These items are great, but did not seem to last long. Are little dashund puppy ( Lacey) went to tearing all the plastic parts out of these toys. But she loved them. Would recommend to everyone i know. Lacey hates the squeaking sound."
Pet_Supplies_5,0,"Got this for my best friends dog. I didn't realize it had a ""cat bell"" rolling around inside it. Thought it was kind of strange to have that in a dog toy, but it's def thick material for a dog to chew on."
Pet_Supplies_5,0,Does a good job of removing small animal urine from the cage and hamster ball. I does not leave any residue and the smell goes away once you wipe it off. The bottle last us 4-5 months with us cleaning three cages weekly.
Pet_Supplies_5,0,"It's really fluffy...that kind of freaks my dog out (LOL) but she will get used to it.  I know that in time it will flatten, but that is to be expected.  I think this  dog bed will work out great!."
Pet_Supplies_5,0,Great toy that my cat loves to play with!  Lots of variety and he can't get enough of playing with the fowl feather.  Product arrived on time and as described.  Great seller who cares about the satisfaction of his customers.
Pet_Supplies_5,0,I have three of these in my home and plan to buy at least one more. With two dogs it is nice to be able to remove and wash. And they are tough and my dogs love them. Plus they are very stylish!
Pet_Supplies_5,0,Medium is a little too long in the legs for my 3 pound morkie. But she will grow into it. The rest fits her body well. Love the color and very warm.  She looks adorable in it! Very happy with my purchase.
Pet_Supplies_5,0,"My dog loves these so much more than nylabones-- I think they're slightly softer to chew apart and don't last quite as long, but my dog hardly touches her nylabones and goes crazy for this toy.  It keeps her occupied for hours."
Pet_Supplies_5,0,Some rope toys are too thin for large dogs.  This one is a thicker rope toy and offers hours a tug related fun for one of my dogs.  These work well to floss dogs teeth if they like to chew on them.
Pet_Supplies_5,0,"I bought it and use it but I don't see much birds like it much  some time three or four days still outside ,, no idea why ,, but its conv delivered home  & I may be change other next time ,,"
Pet_Supplies_5,0,These are SOOOOOOOO Beautiful! I love these!!! I had the gold version before and they lasted about 3 years before the paint started chipping. These are not going to last a lifetime but that is okay -the price is right and they just beautiful.
Pet_Supplies_5,0,My two gerbils roll around and get excited for this more than bath powder and other chinchilla dust brands. Some people have warned against using this because the dust can cause respiratory problems but my gerbils have used this for months with no problems.
Pet_Supplies_5,0,I have two rabbits who are not jumpers. This suits them perfectly! The divider is great providing a nap/potty area from the play area. Even my kitten loves to be in it! Super easy to put together and clean! I will be buying another!
Pet_Supplies_5,0,I got the medium size for my 15 pound Chihuahua mix. It fit under the middle seat very easily I did not have to remove the bottom like other reviews have said to do. I had no problems traveling on Southwest with this carrier
Pet_Supplies_5,0,These really are low to no odor bully sticks! My Golden Retriever loves them...very pleased with these since I have ordered other brands that do not live up to their claim of odor free. Will definitely continue to order Best for My Pets brand.
Pet_Supplies_5,0,"Love it!  Works perfectly with my Python Mini and my Python Small Tall, primes my siphon without disturbing my tank set up, should've gotten one years ago.  It comes with two ends in the box, the smaller one fits both my siphons."
Pet_Supplies_5,0,"Works as it needs, holds our half-grown kitten very well.  Whereas I prefer the stability of a hard-sided carrier, I do not have the space for such things and appreciate that this can store relatively flat.  Naturally, kitty is not a fan."
Pet_Supplies_5,0,Cap was difficult to turn after a short while. Also takes some time to shake and wait for the treats to fall into the small hole to fill it. Otherwise a good toy. I like the adjustable slider to keep treats from pouring out.
Pet_Supplies_5,0,"This wheel is preferred over others by our two mice...have bought them over and over and over.  Hamsters in the past liked the bigger one as well.  Sometimes a little noisy, but not too much...and it doesn't bother us at all anyway."
Pet_Supplies_5,0,"Very effective training harness. ""Puller"" gets redirected at the end of the leash and learns to slow down. My only frustration is that he adjusters on the harness do slip if your dog is an aggressive puller and will need to be readjusted often."
Pet_Supplies_5,0,"My dog loves this toy - this is her second one. She treats it like her baby and carries it around the house in her mouth. The first one is still fine after almost 2 years, I just bought a second one for travel."
Pet_Supplies_5,0,Both of my cockers wear these and they are fantastic for night use.  Highly recommended if you do not have a fenced yard or are prone to taking your dogs outside off leash either after dark or even in the early twilight hours.
Pet_Supplies_5,0,"Did not work at all...my dogs ran right through it with out even a second of hesitation. Unfortunately I waited too long to try it out, so it is past the return policy! DO NOT BUY for large dogs...it might work for a cat!"
Pet_Supplies_5,0,"It looks great in my tank; it's easy to pick up debris from it, my betta loves to rest on the ground (I had rainbow gravel before; it was a nightmare). I bought a second bag because one wasn't enough for my 10 gallon."
Pet_Supplies_5,0,"My 4 months kitten looooves it. The 2 year old hasn't quite figured it out. The constant fountain noise can be annoying if you're sensitive to noise. It stopped bothering me after a week. I mean, it's water, so it's gonna make splash sound..."
Pet_Supplies_5,0,Our vet told us that ticks gave become resistant to frontline and it does not work as well as it used to. It has treated us well for years but after finding several ticks on our dog this year we switched to a newer product.
Pet_Supplies_5,0,"Our beagle has really dry skin in the winter and this product has really given her relief. We have tried everything, but nothing really helped her or they only helped temporarily. After using this for a week she no longer scratches or has dry skin!"
Pet_Supplies_5,0,"Cats had no interest in this toy. I didn't want to give it a one star because the quality is great, and it's just too cute. But, I don't want to rate it high either because my cats are usually interested in everything and anything!"
Pet_Supplies_5,0,These worked great and have held up through the daily washing for weeks. Easy to put in and get off and our puppy didn't seem to mind them so they must be comfortable. (She's never worn outfits before so I worried about this) Fabulous product!
Pet_Supplies_5,0,"All of my three cats prefer other toys with feathers.  With this one they just sit there wondering what the heck it is.  It's very small and actually looks more like a hairball than a mouse, or whatever it's supposed to look like."
Pet_Supplies_5,0,"I can't believe how much the dogs loved this toy. It makes noise by almost any movement and doesn't have an on/off switch. There's a little slot where a plastic tab prevents the noise from happening, but it would be better with an actual switch."
Pet_Supplies_5,0,"Always wanted the Red Shrimp and where to get them is from Obsession all 5 made the trip love to live in my live plants, and are in with my Ghost Shrimp and with my Mirco Mexican crayfish ,now I find myself watching for hours"
Pet_Supplies_5,0,Got these at a great price. Cant beat it since they're something you throw away. I don't believe they are very hold much liquid. But i put down two. My sheltie has a difficult time aiming on one. Love the larger size bc of that.
Pet_Supplies_5,0,Most products don't wow me - this one does. It works EXACTLY how it is advertised. It literally took 2 minutes to clean the litterbox and that includes the litter mess the cat left on the floor (he's an jerk - not the product's fault).
Pet_Supplies_5,0,It was a second set I'd bought.  like the overall look as much as the functionality.  I put it in my kitchen around my dining table to keep my pooch from having accident on the rug. A little pricey but worth the cost.
Pet_Supplies_5,0,It's among the top three favorites for the dog. She's a 20lb Shiba that destroyed the small size rather quickly so this time I got her the wolf size and it's lasting a lot longer and I think she likes having more to hold onto.
Pet_Supplies_5,0,"I have a ragdoll and this is perfect, the bristles are not stiff but are gentle on her skin and the pins pick up any loose hair and snag any knots. She really enjoys being brushed and it's small enough to get into tight spots."
Pet_Supplies_5,0,"Fantastic! Perfect fit for a divided 55 gallon tank, and the cutout meshes almost exactly with my Marineland Penguin 350 filter. I may buy another to replace the old light on the other side of the tank, because the old light is being completely outshined!"
Pet_Supplies_5,0,"This is a really cool little ladder. It is bendable and the screws twist so they're easy to move around through the bars to hook them. I had no issues with mold etc like some of the other people, thankfully. All in all, as advertised!"
Pet_Supplies_5,0,"this product is okay I guess. My dog really have a bad breath, saw online the reviews pretty good try it for a month only, well I can say is his breath improves just a little it's because I can still smell his bad breath."
Pet_Supplies_5,0,I bought this for my dog (Border Collie mix) and she loves it.  It's very comfortable and she can really relax.  I would HIGHLY Recommend this bed.  It's easy to assemble and sturdy.  I also bought a replacement cover as well.
Pet_Supplies_5,0,So cute and perfect for the kitties. NO whisker fatigue. Holds 3/4 cup of dry food which is a pleasant surprise. Also everyone whining about the sticker being hard to get off.... I slapped some goo gone and those stickers were gooooGONE in a jiffy.
Pet_Supplies_5,0,"With 1 large dog and 3 little ones, I have to keep up with the back yard. This is the best item I have found. Easy to use, handles the 'larger' situations very well. I wouldn't order a smaller one, this is the most logical purchase."
Pet_Supplies_5,0,"We have 4 cats. They have all been spayed and/or neutered. One male still sprayed somewhat. We tried the Feliway spray. I'm still trying it out to see is it has any effect, however the plug in units are wonderful and work exceptionally well.  ."
Pet_Supplies_5,0,"This is a good temp pen, but my dog easily knocks it over to escape... Even when he was recovering from a surgery. He would break free to run to the door of the door bell rang. Those plastic children's colorful play pens served me better."
Pet_Supplies_5,0,We have 2 yellow lab mix rescues that will eat anything.  We have several of these around the house.  I run them through the dishwasher to 'freshen' them and the girls think they get a new bone as it must smell better to them.
Pet_Supplies_5,0,My German Shepherds love this as a starter in their food bowls.  The quality can't be beat and the sourcing is reliable and trustworthy.  Worth its weight in gold.  I use this more as a food supplement rather than a primary food source.
Pet_Supplies_5,0,"Beware!! I purchased this a year ago and just bought a second one. It's supposed to be the exact same item, but the new one is very flimsy and much smaller. I'm going to try to return it. I doubt this new version will hold up."
Pet_Supplies_5,0,"My GSDs like these, and they last sufficiently long, even with their rough and constant play.  (One bit the dust, but other is still kicking after a few months).  Dogs really like how this bounces when thrown.  We have several of these squeakers."
