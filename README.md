Coursework completed in university for Deep Learning module

## Project 1
The goal of this initial project comprised of implementing a Multi-Layer Perceptron Network from scratch, utilising **Pandas**, **Numpy**, **Matplotlib** and specific **Scikit-Learn** libraries.

### Task 1 - Initial Model: 
- Implement activation functions (ReLu, Sigmoid, tanh).
- Initialise weights using a uniform distribution U(-1, 1) with bias 0.
- Use mini-batch GD and backpropagation to train the network. 
- Hyperparameters (batch size, learning rate, epochs) were predefined in the assignment specification.

### Task 2 - Evaluation and Metrics:
- Visualised the loss and accuracy across training epochs, and printed the final values.
- Assessed whether the model demonstrated correct learning behaviour (i.e. decreasing loss, stabilising accuracy).

### Task 3 - Optimisation:
- Experimented with varying **learning rates**, **batch sizes**, and **network architectures** (e.g. number of hidden units/layers).
- Experiment with optimisation methods.
- Compare to previous model and explained improvements (or regressions).
